vii</span>ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than forty years ago I edited
the autobiography of the Rev. W. Walford.&nbsp; This book, which
fully answers to its name, is a remarkable production, entering
into the secrets of the author&rsquo;s soul, unveiling the
struggles and sorrows of a mysterious experience.</p>
<p>The work now published is of a very different kind.&nbsp; It
really relates to others more than to myself, and brings within
view some incidents of religious history and aspects of personal
character more interesting than any confined to my own
experience.&nbsp; It presents associations during a long period
spent in various work, in distant journeys, and in friendly
intercourse with many distinguished persons.</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>I
enter into no theological discussion, or any relation of
spiritual conflicts, the results of such introspection, as the
autobiography of my departed friend describes.&nbsp; I only give
recollections of what I have seen and heard, especially in
relation to those whom it has been my privilege to regard as more
or less intimate friends.</p>
<p>It was just after retirement from Kensington that I began to
gather up the following reminiscences, with a permission that my
family might publish them after my decease.&nbsp; They were then
put aside, and not looked at for years.</p>
<p>Within the last few months it has struck me that so many
likely to feel an interest in my Recollections have passed away,
and others are so far advanced in life, that if the publication
be longer delayed, few indeed will be left likely to feel any
interest in my narrative.</p>
<p>Conscious of failures in memory at my advanced age, I have
availed myself of memoranda made when travelling, long before any
book of this kind was contemplated.</p>
<p><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>I have
been greatly helped in this volume by my dear daughter, with whom
I reside, who has frequently accompanied me in my travels, and
been my valued secretary at home.&nbsp; Without her aid I could
not have brought these Recollections through the press.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
1807&ndash;1828</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> born in the parish of St.
Michaels-at-Plea, Norwich, November 18th, 1807.&nbsp; My father
was in some respects a remarkable man.&nbsp; For his great
integrity, he won the name of &ldquo;the honest lawyer&rdquo;; he
would undertake no cause, if unconvinced of its justice, and
declined the office of coroner because its duties would have
shocked his feelings.&nbsp; Of strong understanding, and fond of
reading, after living a thoughtless life, he became an earnest
Christian, and worshipped with Methodists, chiefly from
circumstances&mdash;still regarding himself as a member of the
Established Church.&nbsp; Two elder sisters and an elder brother
of mine were baptised by the parish clergyman; so was I, the
Archdeacon of London being my godfather.&nbsp; I have been told
that I &ldquo;was intended for the Church,&rdquo; and some
Episcopalian friends have amused themselves with <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>speculations as
to what might have been the result.</p>
<p>My mother before she married was a Quakeress, and used to tell
of eminent &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; she knew in her girlhood,
especially Edmund Gurney, who preached &ldquo;with great
power&rdquo; in the Gildencroft Meeting House.&nbsp; She was
brought up a Quakeress by her mother, but her father was, at
least in later life, a staunch Methodist.&nbsp; She remembered
John Wesley, and used to tell how he took her up as a child and
kissed her.</p>
<p>My father died in my fifth year.&nbsp; Of him I have but a
faint recollection.&nbsp; My grandfather, at a distance now of
seventy-five years, visibly stands before me&mdash;a tall old
gentleman with flaxen wig, large spectacles, a long, blue,
bright-buttoned coat, and big buckled shoes.&nbsp; He was Master
of Bethel Hospital, an institution for the insane, in my native
city; and, as I spent much time with him for a year before his
death, I saw and heard a good deal of the patients under his
care.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;I want
to propose a toast&mdash;may the devil never go abroad or receive
visitors at home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What brought you
here?&rdquo; somebody asked an inmate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The loss of
what you never had, or you would not ask such a question,&rdquo;
was <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the
prompt reply.&nbsp; A man who fancied himself King of England
drew on his cell wall pictures of ships which he called his
fleet, and would never speak unless he was addressed as
&ldquo;Your Majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; I once narrowly escaped severe
injury from a woman, who seized me as her child and squeezed me
so hard, that no violence could induce her to relax her grasp;
but gentle words, and a promise that I should be taken care of,
secured my release.&nbsp; Alternate severity and indulgence, at
that time, in the treatment of patients led to a sad tragedy in
the case of my grandfather, who was killed by a man employed as
gardener.&nbsp; He was thought to be harmless, and used to mow
the lawn.&nbsp; One morning he drew the scythe across his
master&rsquo;s body and nearly cut him in two.</p>
<p>My mother had a dream the night before, and saw in it her
father lying on a bed, pale as ashes, which she interpreted as
meaning something terrible would happen to him.&nbsp; When, at
breakfast time, she was told by a gentleman of what had occurred,
she coupled it with what she had seen in her sleep.</p>
<p>We were living at the time in a very old house with
diamond-paned windows, a brick-paved entrance hall, and some
rambling passages.&nbsp; I well remember the little bedroom in
which I slept.&nbsp; <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>There resided with us an old lady, widow of a Norwich
gentleman, who had been a friend of the famous George
Whitefield.&nbsp; She used to tell anecdotes of the popular
preacher&mdash;how he called himself Dr. Squintum, and, when
supping off cowheel, a dish he liked, would say, he wondered what
people would think of his being so employed.</p>
<p>My mother had a strong verbal memory which her son has not
inherited; and it enabled her to instruct and entertain me by
reciting long extracts in prose and poetry.&nbsp; She was a great
reader and did much to instruct and cultivate my mind by her
frequent recitations.&nbsp; My education owes more to this, and
other circumstances, than to schoolmasters under whom I was
placed.&nbsp; However, of course, rudiments of knowledge fell to
my lot in the usual way; but my culture in chief resulted from
devouring books, from instructive conversation, and from the
delight I felt in observing nature, and looking on what was
ancient.&nbsp; When other boys were at play, I liked to get by
myself and read; biography and history having for me pre-eminent
charms.&nbsp; Lord Nelson had been dead only a few years at the
time I speak of, and what I learnt about him as a Norfolk man
immensely gratified my curiosity.&nbsp; His aunt was a friend of
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>my
grandmother, and great was my delight to see and hear such a
distinguished lady; the gratification being enhanced by a bright
shilling she slipped into my hand.&nbsp; The river Wensum, old
trees by the water-side, the picturesque village of Thorpe,
Whitlingham White House and woods, the uplands of Mousehold,
walled-in gardens all over the city, wild hedgerows, sheltered
nooks and corners under weeping willows, cattle feeding in green
meadows, and swans swimming on the river&mdash;these objects
afforded me an &aelig;sthetic education.</p>
<p>From a child I took an interest in historical tales, and felt
delight in listening to my mother&rsquo;s memories of early
days.&nbsp; She recollected the American war, and spoke of a
family dispute amongst her elders, which lasted just as
long&mdash;ten years.&nbsp; Excitement in William Pitt&rsquo;s
day she brought vividly before me; and she told how Thelwall, the
orator, delivered revolutionary harangues, and being attacked by
a mob, he was glad to escape by clambering over the roofs of
houses.&nbsp; The trials of Horne Tooke, Hardy, and others, and
Erskine&rsquo;s famous speeches in their defence, were in my
boyhood modern incidents.&nbsp; Objects in the city excited
arch&aelig;ological tastes.&nbsp; The Norman keep, Herbert de
Lozinga&rsquo;s Cathedral, Erpingham Gate, the Grammar School,
the Bishop&rsquo;s palace, with ruins in <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the garden,
dilapidated towers on the edge of the river, Guild Hall, St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and the Old Men&rsquo;s Hospital&mdash;these
had for me a mighty charm, creating fancies by day and dreams by
night.&nbsp; The East Anglian city had not old houses such as
Prout found on the Continent, but it contained picturesque,
tumble-down tenements, and other &ldquo;bits,&rdquo; sketched in
&ldquo;Highways and Byeways of Old Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
sight of these created a habit of looking after ancient quaint
remains, which has never forsaken me.</p>
<p>Guild day, with its triumphal arches, carpets and flags hung
out of windows, Darby and Joan sitting in a green arbour, the
Mayor&rsquo;s coach attended by &ldquo;Snap,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;whifflers&rdquo;; the rush-strewn cathedral pavement, as
the Corporation marched up the nave&mdash;all this gave birth to
boyish enthusiasm for the picturesque.&nbsp; Every Guild day, on
a green baize platform near the west door of the cathedral, the
head boy of the Grammar School delivered a Latin oration before
his Worship.&nbsp; What envy that boy aroused in my bosom!&nbsp;
Elections, too, were objects of intense interest to me as a
childish politician, when Whig candidates were carried in
blue-and-white satin chairs, on the shoulders of men who tossed
them up, as the Goths did their heroes upon battle shields.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>As to
another part of my education, I loved to read the lives of
eminent people, and devoured a good many memoirs of men and women
in religious magazines.&nbsp; Norwich was at that time
distinguished for literary, artistic, and benevolent celebrities;
and I felt proud as a boy to think of them as pertaining to my
own birthplace.&nbsp; The appearance of several amongst them I
have still, after the lapse of seventy years, vividly before
me&mdash;Mrs. Opie, the Taylors, the Martineaus, Joseph John
Gurney, and Bishop Bathurst, with several beside.</p>
<p>May I add, the first sight of the sea at Yarmouth I can never
forget.&nbsp; It was a November morning in my ninth year.&nbsp;
The sky looked angry; the wind-swept waters and tall billows
broke furiously on the beach; the hulk of a stranded vessel lay
on the sands&mdash;emblem of life&rsquo;s shattered hopes.</p>
<p>Public excitements prevailed in my boyish days beyond what the
present generation has witnessed.&nbsp; After the battle of
Waterloo, and the consequent peace, which was coupled with an
idea of plenty, large loaves were paraded on poles as symbols of
abundant food, mistakenly supposed to come as a natural
consequence now that Buonaparte was conquered.&nbsp; There arose,
instead of this, much distress amongst the lower class, greatly
owing to corn-laws <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>enacted for the protection of agricultural
interests.&nbsp; Bread riots followed, and I now catch glimpses
of a mob in 1816 marching to the New Mills to sack a granary, and
shoot into the flushes of the river Wensum, loads of grain and
flour.&nbsp; Such tumults were surpassed in breadth and depth of
feeling, amongst the upper class, by the excitement attending the
return to England of Queen Caroline after the accession of George
IV. in 1820.&nbsp; Never have I known such agitation in private
circles, as when society split from top to bottom on the question
of her Majesty&rsquo;s character and wrongs.&nbsp; For months
there were almost incessant processions from London to
Hammersmith in honour of the lady, who was sojourning at
Brandenburgh House.&nbsp; Unnumbered addresses were presented to
her, and whenever her carriage appeared, it evoked rapturous
shouts.&nbsp; During her trial things were done and said
startling beyond parallel.&nbsp; Documents full of abominable
details were deposited in a &ldquo;green bag,&rdquo; which called
to mind the words in Job xiv. 17; and when filthy evidence was
furnished on the king&rsquo;s side against his wife, counsel on
her side attacked him as a second Nero, and compared him to the
infernal shadow in Milton, which &ldquo;the likeness of a kingly
crown had on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Round the hearthstone families <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and friends
were divided on this absorbing subject; and such word battles as
Home Rule now occasions were then far surpassed.</p>
<p>My school days over, I entered a lawyer&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;
He put into my hands &ldquo;Blackstone&rsquo;s
Commentaries,&rdquo; which interested me less in what was said
about real and personal property, the rights of things and the
rights of persons, with the law of descent and entail, than in
what appeared touching legislation, and the principles of
government.&nbsp; De Lolme on &ldquo;The Constitution,&rdquo; I
read with avidity.&nbsp; Having to attend the Law Courts at
times, I listened to forensic eloquence with great interest; a
love for oratory being further gratified by hearing speeches at
public meetings when Lord Suffield and Joseph John Gurney
advocated negro emancipation and other reforms.</p>
<p>Theological discussions interested me immensely.&nbsp; The
lawyer in whose office I was became a Roman Catholic, and,
finding me an inquisitive youngster, talked on the subject,
explaining the doctrines and ceremonies of his Church.&nbsp;
Whilst the information he gave me was worth having, I determined
to read Milner&rsquo;s &ldquo;End of Religious
Controversy,&rdquo; and other Catholic books; and beyond my
interest respecting matters of an antiquarian flavour, I felt <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the
importance of ascertaining true grounds for Protestant
beliefs.&nbsp; My master took me once a week to North Walsham,
and in cold winter nights, as the moon shone on the
snow-sprinkled hedges, plied me with arguments for
transubstantiation, purgatory, and the like.&nbsp; I ventured
humbly to dispute his positions, and to contend for truths on the
opposite side; though the match was unequal between a boy of
fifteen and a man of forty, primed by the priest to whom he owed
his conversion.&nbsp; Those night drives were useful, and led me
to see some of the better aspects of Roman Catholic faith and
character, whilst they aroused inquiry, and led to clearer
convictions than I might otherwise have reached respecting
principles in debate.&nbsp; Here let me observe that early
intercourse with friends of different denominations has in the
best sense broadened my habit of looking at questions, and
inspired a tolerance, not of error itself, but of persons holding
error, because they are often better than their creeds, and have
in them a great deal that is good, as well as something of
another quality.&nbsp; Quiet intercourse in early life with
members of various denominations I find to have been a school for
the culture of Christian charity.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Removed
when about sixteen to another office, with the idea of entering
the legal profession, I met with fellow-clerks of education and
taste, who proved very helpful; one in particular became an
intimate friend.&nbsp; He had been a favourite pupil of an
eminent classical schoolmaster, and was well up in Horace.&nbsp;
We had much talk on subjects of common interest.&nbsp; His
temperament had a melancholy tinge, owing to his state of health,
for he was in a slow consumption, but behind dark clouds there
lay a sky full of humour, and his conversation often sparkled
with unaffected wit.&nbsp; He could be a little satirical at the
expense of juvenile follies, in which he did not share; whilst
amiability kept him from giving pain to the most sensitive.&nbsp;
Our friendship continued until his early death, when he passed
away &ldquo;in the faith and hope of the Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst early educational influences which I enjoyed may be
reckoned the opportunities I had of listening to public speakers
of different kinds&mdash;lawyers at the bar, preachers in the
pulpit, orators on the platform, and candidates during elections;
for Norwich was contested most earnestly in my boyhood.&nbsp;
Moreover, the city was remarkable for musical culture.&nbsp; It
had weekly concerts.&nbsp; Festivals also occurred; these I
attended again and again <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>with much enjoyment.&nbsp; My friends
who know my ignorance of music will smile at this.</p>
<p>It might be when I was about seventeen that on a Sunday
morning I took a walk into the country with a volume of
Chalmers&rsquo; sermons under my arm.&nbsp; I read one of them on
Rom. v. 10.&nbsp; The perusal deeply affected me, and on the
evening of the same day, I heard a Methodist minister preach upon
John iii. 16.&nbsp; These two impressions commenced a lifelong
change in my experience and character&mdash;a change so great,
that it led to the abandonment of my former occupation, and
issued in the consecration of my after-days to the Gospel
ministry.</p>
<p>About that time a journey to London on legal business gave me
an opportunity of hearing distinguished preachers, Dr. Adam
Clarke and Dr. Collyer amongst the rest&mdash;a privilege which
deepened my religious convictions.&nbsp; I may observe in
passing, as regards my visit to London, that the first sight of
it, on a dull morning after a night in the Norwich mail, I have
never forgotten&mdash;Bishopsgate-street, the Old Post Office,
and all round the Mansion House&mdash;how different the
neighbourhood appeared in 1826 from what it does now!&nbsp; In
Waterloo-place, Pall Mall, I spent more than a month, and I can
now see George IV. descending <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the steps of Carlton House (where the
Duke of York&rsquo;s column stands), leaning on a page&rsquo;s
shoulder on the way to his carriage.</p>
<p>On returning to Norwich, my thoughts fixed on the subject
which had previously engaged my attention.&nbsp; A few years ago,
when conversing with a friend in the coffee-room of the House of
Commons, a report was mentioned of a certain Dissenting
minister&rsquo;s intention to enter Parliament, if a seat could
be obtained.&nbsp; My friend remarked emphatically, &ldquo;That
would be a come-down.&rdquo;&nbsp; He himself at that time held
office, and was on the way to become a Right Honourable; and when
I expressed my surprise to hear him talk so, he rejoined that he
considered the Gospel ministry as the highest employment on earth
when a man really &ldquo;<i>was called to it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
felt, sixty years ago, exactly in that way, and only wished to
know that such a call awaited me.&nbsp; I spent some months in
coming to a conclusion, and at length felt convinced that it was
my duty and privilege to spend life in Christian preaching and
pastoral work.</p>
<p>Then arose the question, In what ecclesiastical
connexion?&nbsp; My relation to Methodism had arisen from
circumstances, but now some study of ecclesiastical principles
was necessary.&nbsp; I began to read <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>what I could on the subject,
acquainting myself with different sides, and being open to
conviction one way or another.&nbsp; I had no predilections, and
was ready to be either a clergyman or a Dissenting
minister.&nbsp; I arrived at the conclusion that
Congregationalism, <i>on the whole</i>, as far as I understood
it, came nearest to New Testament teaching; but that probably no
existing connexion corresponded exactly with Churches of the
first century.&nbsp; What I thought then has been confirmed by
studies in after-years, devoted largely to the New Testament and
the history of Christendom.&nbsp; I have learned to distinguish
between principles lying at the basis of religious beliefs and
existing organisations through which they are worked out.&nbsp;
The former may be true and sound, whilst the latter are
defective, and in some points mistaken.</p>
<p>It is curious that at the time I first made up my mind I knew
socially next to nothing of Congregationalists as a body; my
chief associations having been with Methodists, Quakers,
Church-people, and a few Roman Catholics.&nbsp; I joined the
venerable society of Christians assembling in the Old Meeting
House, Norwich; its fathers and founders having been gathered
into Church fellowship, during the seventeenth century, under the
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>teaching
and influence of William Bridge, who resided in Yarmouth; some of
the members being Norwich folk.&nbsp; When I expressed my desire
for the ministry to two Dissenting ministers&mdash;the pastor of
the Old Meeting House and his friend who occupied Princes-street
pulpit&mdash;I met with different opinions, the former advising
me to pursue the study of law, the latter encouraging my desire
for the ministry.&nbsp; In the end these two friends concurred in
advice, the consequence being my introduction to Highbury
College, London.</p>
<p>I had from the beginning cautions against forsaking in
after-life the pulpit for any other post.&nbsp; William Godwin,
the famous author of &ldquo;Political Justice&rdquo; and other
works, also W. J. Fox, the Anti-Corn-law lecturer, a
distinguished public character at that time, had been intended
for the Dissenting ministry, and, indeed, entered it.&nbsp; By a
remarkable coincidence, both these distinguished men were
connected with the Old Meeting House, where I then was accustomed
to worship.&nbsp; Their abandonment of an early faith and a
sacred calling for the sake of literature and politics, was held
up to me as a beacon, to warn me off dangerous rocks.</p>
<p>Before noticing my entrance into college, I may <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>be allowed to
mention that the congregation which I joined contained some
noteworthy people.&nbsp; Mr. William Youngman was a hard-headed,
intelligent, and inquisitive man, much given to theological
argument and incisive criticism of current opinions.&nbsp; He
tried the patience of orthodox religionists, and was the terror
of neophytes.&nbsp; Once, when I dined with him, he commenced
talking about original sin as I was hanging up my hat, and went
on in the same strain to the end of my visit.&nbsp; He found his
match at book meetings in Mr. Thomas Brightwell, F.R.S., an
eminent naturalist, whose name is perpetuated in a memoir of a
plant called after him, to be found, if I correctly remember, in
the Transactions of the Royal Society.&nbsp; He was a diligent
student of the Bible, and published notes on the Old Testament,
drawn chiefly from the Scholia of Rosenmuller and Michaelis.</p>
<p>In 1828 I entered Highbury College, afterwards merged in New
College, St. John&rsquo;s Wood; the professors&mdash;or tutors as
they were called in my time&mdash;being Dr. Henderson, Dr.
Burder, and Dr. Halley.&nbsp; Dr. Henderson had been engaged in
foreign missionary and Bible work, spending much time in St.
Petersburg, Copenhagen, and Stockholm, where he became acquainted
with the languages of <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Northern Europe.&nbsp; He drilled us
in the languages of the Old Testament, initiated some small study
in Syriac, and delivered elaborate lectures on the evidences and
doctrines of Christianity.&nbsp; He suggested essays to be
written during the vacation on subjects demanding research, and
he regularly required the careful preparation of comments on the
original Scriptures, to be delivered <i>viva voce</i> in
class.&nbsp; Dr. Burder was son of George Burder, once well known
as the author of &ldquo;Village Sermons.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lectured
on mental and moral philosophy, and employed as text-books the
works of Reid, Stewart, and Brown having himself graduated in a
Scotch university.&nbsp; Exceedingly careful, conscientious, and
precise, he opposed all bold speculations, and was incapable of
sympathy with mystical thinkers.&nbsp; He had a clear
apprehension of whatever he taught, and used to lay down as a
canon of composition.&nbsp; &ldquo;Express yourselves, not so
that you <i>may</i>, but so that you <i>must</i> be
understood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Halley was a good classical scholar,
impulsive, unsystematic, and by no means a severe
disciplinarian.&nbsp; He enthusiastically admired Demosthenes and
Cicero, and to hear him give extempore versions of these orators
was an immense treat.&nbsp; We read with him some Greek
tragedians and Latin poets, and he <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>delivered lectures on history and
antiquities.&nbsp; Mathematics came within his department; but,
certainly in my time, he never turned out a wrangler.&nbsp; His
influence, however, was very stimulative, and he inspired when he
did not instruct.</p>
<p>Defects in the Nonconformist educational system were apparent
to me at that time, much more so have they become to me ever
since; but, to a considerable extent, they arose from
uncontrollable circumstances, so many students having had few
advantages in their boyhood.&nbsp; I have lived to witness a
great improvement in Nonconformist college methods.</p>
<p>It should not be omitted that during the latter part of our
term a few of us attended the mental and moral philosophy class
of Professor Hoppus in the London University College, Gower
Street, that institution having been established by friends of
unsectarian education, and numbering on its councils, and amongst
its officers, several Nonconformists.</p>
<h2><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>CHAPTER II<br />
1828&ndash;1832</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> most distinguished
fellow-student for intellectual power and literary attainment was
Henry Rogers, afterwards a large contributor to the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>.&nbsp; Some of the articles he wrote for that
periodical have been published as essays in three volumes.&nbsp;
His feeble voice stood in the way of his being an effective
preacher; but his learning and ability eminently fitted him for
the duties of a professor.&nbsp; In that capacity he rendered
high service at Spring Hill, Birmingham, and next, at Lancashire
College, Manchester.&nbsp; He was highly esteemed by Lord
Macaulay, and Archbishop Whately; excessive modesty alone
prevented his introduction to the highest literary circles.</p>
<p>He was a clear-headed, acute thinker and reasoner, delighting
in Socratic talk, trotting out <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>an unsuspicious conversationalist,
until he entangled him in inconsistency and contradictions, the
remembrance of which might be afterwards useful.&nbsp; Rogers, to
the end of life, was a humble and devout Christian.&nbsp; Our
intercourse in after-days was pleasant, and to me most
encouraging.</p>
<p>William Drew, who became a devoted Indian missionary, was
another of my contemporaries, and, from sympathy with him, I
caught a portion of his spirit; had I possessed the needful
qualifications, I could have devoted myself to a similar
enterprise.</p>
<p>Samuel Bergne, for many years an able and much-appreciated
secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society, was another
of my fellow-students.&nbsp; With him I became extremely
intimate, owing, in part, to an extraordinary family affair,
which I have been requested to relate.&nbsp; My father, before he
married, had living with him a sister, to whom he was strongly
attached.&nbsp; After their separation, she went to reside in
London, and dropped all correspondence with him; to the day of
his death he could never ascertain what had become of her.&nbsp;
Methods were adopted to find out her residence, but all in
vain.&nbsp; More than <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>thirty years had elapsed since she
disappeared, when one day I met Bergne, who had been visiting his
mother at Brompton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have not you a relative
there?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo;
was my reply.&nbsp; Then he told me that an evening or two
before, as he was sitting by the fire, it flashed upon him how he
had heard that an old friend of his mother&rsquo;s, before her
marriage, bore the same name as mine; that she came from Norwich,
and that her brother was a lawyer.&nbsp; I was taken aback by
what my friend said, and then related what I had heard in
childhood respecting my father&rsquo;s long-lost sister.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I have found
for you the lady your family have been seeking in
vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; I soon received a request to meet the stranger
at Mrs. Bergne&rsquo;s house, when something like a scene
occurred, as the separated relatives stood face to face.&nbsp;
Yet neither then nor afterwards did she shed any light upon the
mystery.&nbsp; She had a husband who proved to be no less a
mystery.&nbsp; We never could learn anything about his
connections; but, at the time of my introduction to him he was
engaged on <i>The Morning Post</i>.&nbsp; We afterwards learned
from himself, as well as others, that he had been employed in
this country as an agent of the Imperial French Court; certainly
he <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>had in
his possession a key to the cipher-writing, used by the first
Napoleon.&nbsp; He showed me relics of that extraordinary man,
and had much to say of several notabilities at home and
abroad.&nbsp; What of fact mingled with fiction in his strange
disclosures I cannot say; but, after his death, I saw some of his
papers, including an unintelligible correspondence between Mr.
Canning and himself; also letters relating to private scandals of
great people, only fit to be thrown into the fire.&nbsp; He lived
in an imaginary world, and used to say that Napoleon Buonaparte
was still living.&nbsp; To his influence, I suppose, the mystery
which shrouded my aunt&rsquo;s life after her marriage, might be
ascribed.</p>
<p>The four years I spent at Highbury were marked by much
political excitement.&nbsp; In 1828 the Corporation and Test Acts
were repealed.&nbsp; The Catholic Relief Bill was carried in
1829.&nbsp; In 1830 William IV. succeeded his brother.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;three days of July&rdquo; the same year occurred in Paris:
the abdication of Charles X., and the accession of Louis
Philippe, swiftly followed each other; and a fresh impetus was
thus given to the cause of English liberalism.&nbsp; The Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s protest against reform, the defeat of the
Ministry on the Civil List, and the introduction of the Reform
Bill the next year, <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>produced an excitement which I do not think has been
equalled since, though for passionate discussion in the homes of
England, it has been surpassed by what occurred during the trial
of Queen Caroline.&nbsp; Earl Grey, Lord Brougham, and Lord John
Russell were popular idols, their names in everybody&rsquo;s
mouth, their portraits looking down from innumerable shop
windows, their busts set up in house after house, their
likenesses printed on handkerchiefs and stamped on pipes and
jugs, and all sorts of ware.&nbsp; They were mobbed and hurrahed
wherever they went, and their carriages were dragged by the
populace through streams knee-deep.</p>
<p>At that period the old House of Commons was standing, and went
by the name of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Chapel.&nbsp; Within its walls
the Reform battle was fought; and there still lingered round it
memories of Pitt and Fox, Burke and Sheridan.&nbsp; I had a great
curiosity to see this English forum, and when I obtained
admission, with my tutor, Dr. Halley, who explained the building
and what was going on, I seemed to be in an old Presbyterian
meeting-house, with galleries on three sides, the Speaker&rsquo;s
chair, with its wooden canopy, resembling a pulpit, at the
farther end.&nbsp; Members were &ldquo;cribbed, cabined, and
confined.&rdquo;&nbsp; The forms of the House were interesting <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>to me, and
afforded a framework in which to insert images of men in the
reign of George II.&nbsp; I had but to put Court dresses and
cocked hats on the members, and forthwith the age of Walpole came
back to view.&nbsp; A messenger from the Lords, the bowing of an
officer as he approached the table, with its wigged clerks, and
other matters of ceremony illustrated my readings of Parliament
business in olden times.</p>
<p>One figure especially I now recall&mdash;that of Sir Charles
Wetherall, a fierce opponent of reform.&nbsp; Up he rose,
violently gesticulating, his shirt very visible between his black
waistcoat and dark nether garment.</p>
<p>The coronation of William IV. and Queen Adelaide indicated a
change in that august ceremonial, which showed how reform touched
royal pageantry.&nbsp; Though an instance of a double coronation,
it came short of the elaborate display when the previous monarch
sat alone in Edward&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; I saw the procession
going down to Westminster, along a narrow street at Charing
Cross&mdash;old-fashioned shabby shops standing where now you
catch sight of palatial hotels&mdash;old Northumberland House,
with its gardens, occupying the space now become a broad
avenue.&nbsp; The beefeaters, the trumpeters, <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and the
footmen in attendance upon the gaudy state-coach, with its royal
occupants, were very picturesque.&nbsp; And what a crush there
was to avoid the mob streaming down from the Haymarket!</p>
<p>All sorts of reports were afloat, tending to make the new king
popular.&nbsp; It was said, that immediately after his accession,
he came to town in the dickey of his carriage, and invited, after
an unceremonious manner, his old naval friends to come and dine
with him.&nbsp; A story went the round with rare applause that,
after the defeat of the Reform Bill, when he wanted to dissolve
Parliament, he said if the royal carriages could not be got
ready, he would go in a hackney coach.&nbsp; How far such tales
were true I do not know; but a nobleman, present at one of His
Majesty&rsquo;s dinner-parties at the Brighton Pavilion, told me
that, on that occasion, the king toasted some of his guests in
sailor fashion, and remarked that his seafaring pursuits had
scarcely fitted him for a throne.&nbsp; Then, pointing to the
queen, he added that for any improvement in his ways he was
indebted to that good lady.&nbsp; The story raised him in my
estimation and that of many others.</p>
<p>I must now turn from politics and royalty to what was more in
my own way.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>The
Rev. Daniel Wilson, afterwards Bishop of Calcutta, stood high
amongst London Evangelicals as Vicar of Islington, and I
sometimes heard him in his crowded church; but my great delight
was to walk down to Camberwell to listen to Henry Melvill, then
in the zenith of his popularity.&nbsp; His manner was
peculiar&mdash;he had a curious shake of the head, and a strange
inflection of voice at the end of a sentence, which kept up
attention.&nbsp; As to style, he was artificial in the extreme;
every paragraph seeming to be planned on the same model, ending
with the words of his text as a well-turned climax.&nbsp; The
preacher swept his auditors along with the force of a torrent
from point to point.&nbsp; I heard him at Barnes, when he was
advanced in life, deliver one of his old discourses, I should
judge little, if at all, altered; but it lacked the fire of early
days, and the congregation evinced little of the sympathy which
seemed to quiver in London churches at the sound of his voice
twenty or thirty years before.</p>
<p>Rowland Hill, though a very old man in 1830, continued to fill
Surrey Chapel with a crowded audience.&nbsp; I listened to a
sermon in which he recommended young people when they set up
house-keeping to secure one piece of furniture <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>especially&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the looking-glass of a
good conscience, so that husband and wife, keeping it clean,
might see themselves in it, with joy and thankfulness; &ldquo;for
a good man is satisfied from himself,&rdquo; and, he added,
&ldquo;so is a good woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Angell James, of
Birmingham, was one of the most popular preachers at that time,
and he occasionally occupied Surrey Chapel pulpit; but William
Jay, of Bath, was a more regular &ldquo;supply,&rdquo; and echoes
of his sonorous voice I still catch as I read his pithy and
impressive sermons.&nbsp; When he came to preach Rowland
Hill&rsquo;s funeral sermon I had left college, and he honoured
me with an invitation to preach for him at Bath the Sunday
following.&nbsp; In 1886, when I occupied the same pulpit in my
old age, a lady told me that she remembered my being there more
than fifty years before, when the people wondered at their
pastor&rsquo;s sending &ldquo;such a boy to take his
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; A similar occurrence had happened when Jay
first preached for Rowland Hill.</p>
<p>James Parsons, of York, was a frequent visitor to London, and
used to occupy for several Sundays in the year the pulpit of
Moorfields Tabernacle, and that of Tottenham Court Chapel.&nbsp;
Congregations gathered an hour before service to listen to this
youthful preacher.&nbsp; He had been educated for the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>law, and,
with a strong taste for rhetorical efforts, had cultivated, by
the study of English authors, his own extraordinary gift for
public speaking.&nbsp; Almost inaudible at first, his voice would
gradually rise into tones shrill and penetrating; and after
repeated pauses, when people relieved themselves by bursts of
coughing, he would, during his peroration, wind them up to such a
pitch of excitement as I have never witnessed since.&nbsp; He was
thoroughly evangelical and devout, and did an immense deal of
spiritual good.&nbsp; I became intimately acquainted with him in
after-years, and found in his friendship a source of much
enjoyment.&nbsp; His conversations in the parlour were as full of
anecdote and humour as his sermons in the pulpit were of pathos
and power.&nbsp; I have heard a member of Parliament, one of his
deacons at York, say that Mr. Parsons&rsquo; eloquence in early
days was perfectly electrifying, and that, as he listened to him
at that time, he felt as if he must lay hold on the top of his
pew to prevent being swept away by the force of the
preacher&rsquo;s appeals.</p>
<p>Edward Irving occupied the Caledonian Church in Hatton Garden,
a retired and ugly-looking Presbyterian meeting-house; but the
nobility flocked round him, and it was picturesque to see Scotch
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>schoolboys
in Highland kilts placed in front of the pulpit.&nbsp; As I was
trying to get in at a side door, up walked the gigantic orator,
with his black locks and broad-brimmed beaver, as if an old
Covenanter had risen from the dead.&nbsp; An infant lying in the
arms of that strong man added to the effect of the picture.&nbsp;
His manner at that period was grand.&nbsp; His sermons were
carefully prepared and read, every word, but with a blended
majesty and pathos which no extempore utterance could exceed; and
his reading of the twenty-third Psalm, Scotch version, was
inimitable.&nbsp; His favourite word,
&ldquo;<i>Fatherhood</i>,&rdquo; quoted by Mr. Canning with
admiration, and now so hackneyed, impressed religious people
wonderfully by its freshness.&nbsp; A fellow-student took me some
time afterwards to call on him at his house in the then New
Road.&nbsp; He was unwell and sat by the fireside wrapped in a
blue gown.&nbsp; He talked to me for some time on the subject of
baptism, the right understanding of which, he said, was a key to
many theological questions.&nbsp; I could not assent to all he
said, nor indeed understand it, but did not dare, at my age, to
make any reply.&nbsp; When he had ended he slowly rose from his
chair.&nbsp; It seemed as if he would never finish rising, he was
so tall.&nbsp; When erect, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>he waved his hand to a nursemaid, who
was walking across the room with a babe in her arms, and then,
placing his hand on my head, he offered a solemn intercession,
suggesting the idea of a Hebrew prophet blessing a young
Israelite.</p>
<p>At a later period he took up peculiar views on prophecy, and
on some ecclesiastical points.&nbsp; Then he became wild and
incoherent.&nbsp; I heard him preach outside Coldbath Prison to a
few bystanders, very differently from what he had done in Hatton
Garden.&nbsp; He seemed to have lost unction as well as
thoughtfulness and eloquence.&nbsp; On a cold winter morning,
before breakfast, several students and myself walked down to his
new church in Regent Square to witness &ldquo;the gift of
tongues,&rdquo; which, amongst other imaginations, he believed
had been miraculously bestowed.&nbsp; The building was dark, for
the sun had not risen, and the mysterious gloom heightened the
effect of the exhibition which followed.&nbsp; First arose
inarticulate screams, then exclamations of &ldquo;He is
coming!&rdquo; &ldquo;He is co-m-i-ng!&rdquo; drawn out in
marvellous quavers.&nbsp; What appeared to me inarticulate and
incomprehensible sounds, were regarded by him and many people as
Divine utterances.&nbsp; They deemed them the return of
Pentecost&mdash;a gift of tongues.&nbsp; At London Wall Church I
saw him afterwards arraigned <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>before the presbytery for heretical
opinions touching the Lord&rsquo;s humanity.&nbsp; He fought his
battle manfully; and whatever people might think of his
sentiments, they could scarcely fail to be impressed with the
sincerity and earnestness of the man.&nbsp; The trial issued in
his expulsion from Regent Square&mdash;poor fellow!&nbsp; It is
touching to think of his history; popularity was his snare.&nbsp;
It turned his head; yet, after all, he sacrificed that very
popularity to sincere convictions.&nbsp; His latest life was an
instance of martyrdom for conscience&rsquo; sake.&nbsp; Those who
condemn his opinions must honour the man.</p>
<p>Dr. Chalmers came to preach at Regent Square.&nbsp; After the
benefit derived from his printed sermons, I might well desire to
hear his voice.&nbsp; The pitch of excitement to which he wrought
himself up surpassed everything of the kind I ever
witnessed.&nbsp; His vehemence was terrific, yet all seemed
natural.&nbsp; He was John Knox over again&mdash;John Knox in
manner, more than John Knox in thought and eloquence of
expression.&nbsp; He moved on &ldquo;hinges,&rdquo; as Robert
Hall said, or rather, &ldquo;like a cloud, that moveth
altogether, if it move at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact is, he felt
what he was saying.&nbsp; It went down to the depths of his own
soul, and hence it reached the <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>souls of others.&nbsp; The crowd in
the church was immense, numbers standing all the time; yet it was
curious to learn that the sermon was already in print&mdash;in
print, I believe, years before.&nbsp; He often redelivered his
discourses, even after publication; and Dr. Wardlaw of Glasgow
told me his distinguished neighbour informed him, that he tried
to lessen the crowds at church by announcing that next time he
meant to deliver what they had heard already.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; with a childlike simplicity the old man added,
&ldquo;they come in still larger numbers than
before!&rdquo;&nbsp; Not many preachers are troubled in that
way.</p>
<p>At the time now referred to, religious services were not
multiplied as at present; hence great interest was taken amongst
London Congregationalists in what were called &ldquo;Monthly
Lectures,&rdquo; given by ministers who carefully prepared what
they delivered.&nbsp; Three come back to my recollection
now.&nbsp; The first, in Jewin Street, was delivered by Dr.
Collyer, a popular divine, who attracted the notice of royalty,
and had the Dukes of Kent and of Sussex to hear him.&nbsp; I knew
him well in after-days, when he spoke of friendly intercourse
with him, vouchsafed on the part of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
father.&nbsp; The subject of the doctor&rsquo;s lecture was <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>&ldquo;Our
Colonial Empire,&rdquo; and a felicitous text was selected from
Ezek. xxviii. 14&ndash;16.&nbsp; He urged on his audience the
claims of distant colonies, then much neglected; and he painted
vivid pictures of England&rsquo;s commercial wealth and vast
possessions, insisting strongly on our national
responsibilities.&nbsp; The second I remember was in Claremont
Chapel, from the lips of my tutor, Dr. Halley, on the importance
of intercessory prayer, showing its place in Church history, as a
pivot on which turned events of unutterable importance.&nbsp; A
third, at Bermondsey, was delivered by a minister of great pulpit
gifts, named Dobson, who discoursed on the topic of the final
resurrection.&nbsp; I am not in the habit of saying the former
days were better than these, yet I may be permitted to express my
opinion that those three lectures would bear favourable
comparison with the best productions in Nonconformist homiletics
at the present day.&nbsp; Among venerable forms present at these
lectures, to officiate or listen, were Dr. Winter, of New Court,
now covered by buildings sacred to the law, a man of high repute,
stout in figure, and strong in opinion; and Dr. Pye Smith, spare,
attenuated, ethereal in presence, Melancthon-like in spirit, and
as full of learning as Melancthon, with scientific knowledge <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>which
entitled him to the place he held by the side of accomplished
geologists.&nbsp; I may also mention James Stratten, of
Paddington, who had an eagle&rsquo;s eye, and a combination of
face, voice, thought, and style which rendered him unique amongst
preachers,&mdash;like Rembrandt amongst artists&mdash;rich in
lights and shadows.&nbsp; Nor should Dr. Fletcher, of Stepney, be
forgotten, whose purity of thought, felicity of diction, and
depth of evangelical sentiment attracted large audiences.&nbsp;
The Claytons were well-known members of this goodly
fellowship.&nbsp; How these and other names are passing out of
remembrance!</p>
<p>Looking back to &ldquo;sixty years since,&rdquo; I am struck
with the difference between certain aspects of Metropolitan
Nonconformity presented then, and others familiar now.&nbsp;
Indeed, a similar state of things is obvious when we turn to the
religious history of other great cities.&nbsp; Citizens then for
the most part <i>lived</i> in London.&nbsp; Westminster and the
opposite side of the Thames saw, on Sundays and week days, in the
same neighbourhood both the poor and rich.&nbsp; Thus pious
families exerted an immediate and constant influence where they
lived, and my remembrance of Metropolitan domestic life then is
intensely gratifying.&nbsp; There were happy homes in London
where now want and misery abound.&nbsp; Organised district <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>work goes on,
but it is a poor substitute for the presence of godly and
philanthropic people in their own homesteads, coming in constant
contact with those who needed sympathy and help.</p>
<p>Efforts were not wanting for the benefit of London on the part
of Christian people in general.&nbsp; The City Mission had then
been recently founded, and students in Highbury College lent a
hand in work amongst the poor.&nbsp; I remember a district in
existence, called Saffron Hill, full of old tenements now swept
away.&nbsp; Some fellow-students went with me to the spot on a
Sunday afternoon, and we preached from a doorstep, while women
looked down from their windows, and perhaps men below were
smoking their pipes.&nbsp; Drury Lane was a dirty, neglected
neighbourhood; and, in a room hired there, we conducted a service
on Sunday nights.&nbsp; Sometimes disturbances arose, but the
work went on.&nbsp; Nor were certain districts in the country
round London neglected.&nbsp; There we preached and visited the
aged sick, praying by the bedside, and ministering such
instruction and comfort as we were able.</p>
<p>Public religious meetings in those days were comparatively
rare, and the style of speaking was different from what it is
now&mdash;more ornate, with apostrophes and appeals of a kind
which has <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>vanished away.&nbsp; The annual Bible gathering was held
in Freemasons&rsquo; Hall, the floor covered with a
closely-packed audience.&nbsp; A passage was partitioned off on
the left hand side for the access of speakers to the platform,
who were eagerly watched, and loudly applauded, as they
approached, their heads amusingly bobbing up and down as they
quickened their pace.&nbsp; The diminutive William Wilberforce,
eye-glass in hand, his head on one side, came skipping along; Dr.
Ryder, Bishop of Gloucester, with big wig, and smooth apron,
followed at a more dignified pace; Cunningham, Noel, and other
evangelical celebrities were sure to be present.&nbsp; Rowland
Hill, by his quizzical look, and humorous tongue, could not fail
to make a mark; and Burnet of Cork, who afterwards became pastor
of the Independent Congregation, Camberwell, was a vast
favourite, his rising to speak being a signal for loud
cheers.&nbsp; There he would stand, calmly extemporising
sentences which exactly hit the occasion, and the
audience&mdash;all eyes turned towards him&mdash;upturned faces
seeming, as he said, to resemble &ldquo;a tesselated
pavement.&rdquo;&nbsp; He liked to compare North and South
Ireland with one another, as showing the contrast between a
Bible-reading and a Bible-ignoring population.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>After
Exeter Hall had been opened there arose a tremendous controversy
about Unitarians and the Bible Society.&nbsp; Some well-known
speakers could not get a hearing, and the scene on the platform
was terribly confused, until Rowland Hill rose and put the
assembly in good humour, by remarking that he &ldquo;would accept
the Bible from the hands of the devil; only he would keep him at
a distance, and take his gift with a pair of tongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same place anti-slavery meetings were held.&nbsp; I
remember one in particular when, besides Buxton and Mackintosh,
O&rsquo;Connell and Sheil were present.&nbsp; Mackintosh spoke
with philosophical calmness.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Connell was full of
invective, satire, and pathos; one moment terrific in
denunciation, then heart-melting in tones of sympathy; now
stamping with his foot, and laying hold of his scratch wig, as if
he would tear it in pieces; next, with gentle whispers, drawing
tears, or creating laughter.&nbsp; Sheil, in a torrent of
declamation, was carried off his legs, borne along by his own
impetuosity, completely overmastered by himself; whilst his Irish
friend never lost self-control amidst most violent storms of
passion.</p>
<p>Some time afterwards, I listened to Lord Brougham in the same
hall on the same subject.&nbsp; He was <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>then past his best days, but flashes
of oratory, full of satire and invective against the party he had
left, burst forth in a long speech, which, as chairman, he
delivered in the middle of the proceedings, to the interruption
of previous arrangements.&nbsp; It was, I suppose, by no means
equal to his earlier efforts, but enough remained of thunder and
lightning to remind one of his eulogised resemblance to
Demosthenes.</p>
<h2><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>CHAPTER III<br />
1832&ndash;1837</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I first saw Windsor in the
winter of 1830&ndash;31 how different the town appeared from what
it did afterwards!&nbsp; All about Thames Street and Castle Hill
was crowded with old houses and shops on both sides of the way,
and the walls bounding Lower Ward were hidden from view, except
where the Clock Tower, which stood in advance, looked down upon
the passers-by.&nbsp; A large plain brick mansion, called the
Queen&rsquo;s Lodge, long since removed, occupied the right hand
of the road leading to York and Lancaster Gate, while
old-fashioned tenements lined the approach to the royal
precincts.&nbsp; On the night of my first arrival patches of snow
covered the roofs, and dotted the pediments of doors and windows;
over Henry VIII.&rsquo;s gateway hung a gorgeous hatchment in
memory of George IV., who had not long before left this
life.&nbsp; <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>It was slow travelling from London to Windsor in those
days, especially when the waters were out, and the roads were
heavy, and thick fogs rendered the leaders invisible to the
coachman; whilst deep ruts clogged the wheels and now and then an
icy flood came up to the axles.&nbsp; In the town I heard a great
deal about &ldquo;Windsor of the olden time,&rdquo; when highway
robbers were rife, and gentlemen who took to the road would lie
in wait under cover of a plantation, and, galloping over a field,
stop the traveller and lighten him of his purse.&nbsp; According
to one informant, a tradesman in High Street, at the latter part
of the eighteenth century, kept a swift-trotting nag, which he
mounted after dark to do a little business on the road, and then
returned richer than he went.&nbsp; People at that time, as I
heard some of them say, did not think of riding or driving over
Hounslow Heath alone; but, when approaching that ill-famed spot
where gibbets lingered by the roadside, were careful to wait till
a number was formed able to defend themselves against the attack
of thieves.&nbsp; The sobriety of many inhabitants in the royal
borough did not stand high, and at mayors&rsquo; feasts the
guests did not think they sufficiently honoured the hospitalities
of the evening, unless they drank so much <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>as made it
difficult for them to find their way home.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of George III. were rife.&nbsp; I heard that he used
to rise early, take a walk before breakfast, and sit down in a
certain bookseller&rsquo;s shop, looking at publications on the
counter.&nbsp; But one morning he saw a book by Tom Paine lying
there; after that he paid no more visits.&nbsp; Sometimes he said
very shrewd things.&nbsp; A Bow-street runner, named Townsend,
liked to attend early prayers when His Majesty was present, and
to make himself heard in loud responses.&nbsp; One day he was
running about after service looking for something he could not
find.&nbsp; &ldquo;Townsend, Townsend, what are you
after?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have lost my hat, please your
Majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You prayed well,&rdquo; was the
monarch&rsquo;s rejoinder; &ldquo;but you did not
watch.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king had a wonderful memory; and once, as
a troop of yeomanry rode past in review, he pointed out a man
amongst them of whom he had bought a horse twenty years before,
and whom he had not seen afterwards.</p>
<p>An old inhabitant, who became my father-in-law, vouched for
the truth of some of these stories; and bore testimony, not only
to the condescension and familiarity of George III., but to the
kindness <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>and consideration of George IV.&nbsp; One remark which
my friend and relative used to make as he was walking through the
apartments of the castle, produced a startling effect.&nbsp;
Stopping before the picture of Charles I., he would say:
&ldquo;He looks just as he did when I last saw him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The fact was that my relative was present when Sir Henry Halford
superintended the exhumation of the beheaded king; and he first
caught a glimpse of the royal face, because he assisted in
cutting open the coffin lid.&nbsp; The face was perfect, and
exactly resembled Vandyke&rsquo;s famous portrait of Charles
I.&nbsp; When exposed to the air the dust crumbled away.</p>
<p>After preaching at Windsor, as a student, several times, I
received an invitation to become co-pastor of the Congregational
church.&nbsp; The Rev. A. Redford, a man of singular consistency
of character, who by his conduct as a Christian minister won the
respect and confidence of the town generally, as well as of his
own little flock, had been in office for many years, and needed
assistance in his sacred calling.&nbsp; He won my heart; and as a
son with a father I laboured with him in the gospel.&nbsp; George
III., who had a domestic or two in his household attending on
this good man&rsquo;s preaching, was heard to say: &ldquo;The
clergy are paid by the country to pray <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>for me, but Mr. Redford&rsquo;s
praying is without pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the prospect of my becoming co-pastor, the congregation in
1832 determined to build a new chapel, the one in existence being
not sufficiently large; and as a sign of the honour in which the
senior minister was held, I may mention, that Church-people, as
well as Dissenters, contributed to the fund.&nbsp; The late Earl
of Derby, then Mr. Stanley, who represented the borough,
subscribed &pound;50.&nbsp; The other member gave a like
sum.&nbsp; The vicar and almost all the leading inhabitants were
found on the list.&nbsp; The fact is now mentioned to indicate
the good understanding between different classes of religionists
which then existed in Windsor.</p>
<p>I was ordained the day after the new chapel was opened, at the
beginning of May 1833.&nbsp; It was a service long to be
remembered.&nbsp; Such services were thought more of in those
days than they are now.&nbsp; Ministers and friends came from a
great distance, and a large congregation was sure to
assemble.&nbsp; Generally the spirit was devout.&nbsp; An
introductory discourse illustrated the grounds of
Nonconformity.&nbsp; After this several questions were answered
by the candidate, as to his Christian experience, doctrinal
sentiments, and reasons for <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>believing he had a call to the
ministry.&nbsp; A deacon of the Church related the steps which
had led to the present choice, and, afterwards, the ordination
prayer was offered with a solemn laying on of hands.&nbsp; In my
case, my venerated co-pastor fulfilled this duty; and it was
interesting to me that, in like manner, he had been ordained by
Rowland Hill.&nbsp; A charge to the inducted minister followed;
then came a sermon to the people, pointing out their
duties.&nbsp; The holy influence of that day rests on me to this
hour, after the lapse of more than fifty years.</p>
<p>The fresh impetus now given to our religious work served to
stimulate friends in the Establishment, who had so helped us in
our department of the one great cause.&nbsp; A Sunday evening
service was commenced in the parish church, and a new Episcopal
place of worship was erected in Eton, where it was much
needed.&nbsp; In addition to the vicar of Windsor and his
curates, some of the masters at Eton College came forward in
parish work, rendering help by sermons at a third Sunday service
then recently commenced.&nbsp; The Rev. T. Chapman, afterwards a
Colonial bishop, took the lead, and did much to revive religion
in the town.&nbsp; But the most distinguished labourer at the
time was the Rev. G. A. Selwyn, then connected with <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Eton, who was
afterwards one of the most heroic missionary bishops of modern
times; with him it was my privilege to co-operate in the
establishment of the Windsor Infants&rsquo; School.</p>
<p>lie would fain have induced me to enter the Establishment, but
though he did not succeed in that respect, he ever treated me
with a brotherly regard, which I sincerely reciprocated.&nbsp;
Before he embarked for his distant field of labour he wrote a
farewell note in which he said: &ldquo;On the few points in which
we differ, I thank God we have been enabled to dwell, often at
some length, without one particle of that acrimony which often
discredits controversy, and proves it to proceed rather from
human passions than from zeal for the truth of God.&nbsp; I
cannot recollect, throughout all our intercourse, one single word
which can be considered as a breach of charity between us.&nbsp;
For this I am especially thankful, that when I go to offer up my
gift upon far distant altars, I shall have left no brother at
home, with whom I ought first to have been reconciled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a ticket for St. George&rsquo;s Chapel when William IV.
was interred.&nbsp; The interior of the building was dark, except
as illumined by torches in the hands of soldiers who lined the
nave, and <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>by numerous lights within the choir.&nbsp; When the
procession drew up about nine o&rsquo;clock, at the south
entrance, the blaze of outside torches was seen through the
stained windows; then the appearance of heralds in their tabards
followed: next the slow march of mourners close to the coffin,
the Duke of Sussex being most conspicuous; afterwards a funeral
dirge echoed from the fretted roof.&nbsp; The silence was further
broken by the Burial Service and the repetition of royal
titles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sic transit gloria mundi&rdquo; came last,
and left an ineffaceable impression.</p>
<p>I was further favoured with a ticket to see the coronation in
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; When the procession entered the nave,
officers of state and foreign ambassadors appeared in rich
costume.&nbsp; Diamond-decked coats and rich mantles made a grand
show, yet they chiefly served to set off the simple dignity of
the queen in her early girlhood, whilst a spell of loyalty
touched spectators looking down from lofty galleries.&nbsp; The
coronation shout of &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; needed to be
heard that it might be fully understood.&nbsp; Afterwards, a
stream of dignified personages, with mantles and coronets, issued
from the choir and covered the nave with a tesselated pattern of
rich colours.</p>
<p>To the coronation succeeded the royal marriage, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>honoured at
Windsor by extraordinary festivities; and at night the
cort&eacute;ge of the bride and bridegroom, on their way to the
castle through decorated and illuminated streets, evoked a
rapturous welcome from assembled thousands.&nbsp; But what above
all other incidents of that occasion lives in my memory at the
present moment is the sudden view which I caught a day or two
afterwards of the wedded pair in a pony carriage, driven by the
bridegroom as his bride nestled beside him, under his wing, with
simplicity which gave exquisite finish to the chief pictures
which passed before me that summer.</p>
<p>Another incident may be mentioned.&nbsp; At a town meeting it
was proposed that an address of congratulation should be
presented to Her Majesty by the mayor and others.&nbsp; The
presentation followed at a lev&eacute;e.&nbsp; It was interesting
to see notabilities assembled in St. James&rsquo;s Palace at the
first public reception by Her Majesty after the royal
marriage.&nbsp; Amongst a crowd of noblemen in the ante-room were
pointed out, in particular, Dr. Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter,
with an eagle eye indicative of his intellect, and Joseph Hume,
the sturdy economist; both of them much talked of at that
period.&nbsp; Others I have forgotten.&nbsp; After waiting we
were ushered <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>into the presence, the Queen, with Prince Albert at her
side, occupying a place near a window not far from the entrance
door.&nbsp; Since that I have knelt before Her Majesty more than
once, but how great the difference between the first and last
occasions&mdash;the girl become a matron, the sparkling bride a
sorrowful widow, and the newly-married wife a mother with sons
and daughters standing round in reverence and affection.</p>
<p>If I may here anticipate a Windsor ceremonial of later date,
let me mention the royal presentation of colours to a regiment of
Highlanders to which I acted as chaplain.&nbsp; The colours were
bestowed in the quadrangle of the castle on the day when the
christening of the Prince of Wales took place.&nbsp; The Prince
Consort, the King of Prussia, and the Duke of Wellington, with
several other grandees, formed a group under the shadow of the
castle porch.&nbsp; As chaplain to the regiment I was allowed to
stand near, and was struck with the Prince&rsquo;s German accent,
which he seemed to conquer in later life, when he spoke almost
like a born Englishman.&nbsp; The Duke addressed the soldiers in
his accustomed plain style, giving them very good advice.&nbsp;
Preparations for the banquet in St. George&rsquo;s Hall, which a
number of people were allowed to <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>see, were very magnificent, tables
being covered with gold and silver plate.&nbsp; Some antique
pieces brought from the Tower were of special interest.&nbsp; In
the evening I joined the non-commissioned officers, to whom a
dinner was given, and I was glad of an opportunity to recall to
their minds the Duke&rsquo;s address.&nbsp; This Highland
regiment while in Windsor attended worship in our chapel, when
the band accompanied the singing, and Highland bonnets hung
round, outside the galleries.&nbsp; I visited the barracks,
conversed and prayed with the sick, and baptised the
children.&nbsp; My relations with the colonel and the officers
were pleasant during the whole time that the Scotch remained in
Windsor.</p>
<p>Going back a few years, let me notice &ldquo;Eton
Montem,&rdquo; then witnessed in all its splendour.&nbsp;
Approaches to the college were guarded by boys in fancy costumes:
coloured velvet coats, yellow boots, caps decorated with graceful
plumes, appeared on the scene.&nbsp; The youngsters levied a tax
on all comers, calling it &ldquo;<i>salt</i>,&rdquo; which they
deposited in bags suspended from their necks.&nbsp; As royal
carriages swept across Windsor bridge, picturesque sentinels
received handsome donations from royal hands.&nbsp; The gifts,
together with a large number of others, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>formed a fund
for the captain of the school to defray his expenses at
Cambridge, whither he was sent in prospect of a fellowship.&nbsp;
The procession of boys to Salt Hill, where the captain waved a
flag after a prescribed fashion, excited immense interest, and
was witnessed by multitudes.&nbsp; The sight in the college
gardens as the day closed, afforded perhaps the best of the
pageant, for these lads, attired in Turkish, Greek, Italian, and
other showy garbs, mixed with their friends so as to form a
picture of animated life, with old trees and old buildings for a
background.</p>
<p>I had not been long in the town before I became intimately
connected with the British and Foreign Bible Society, which laid
a strong hold on my affections as a boy, and to which I firmly
adhered, after I became a man.&nbsp; Our auxiliary was a
flourishing one.&nbsp; Some relatives of Lord Bexley, president
of the parent society, lived in our neighbourhood, and used to
come over to our annual gatherings in the Town Hall.&nbsp; One of
them, the Rev. Mr. Neal, of Taplow, was a constant visitor.&nbsp;
He typified a class of men now almost extinct.&nbsp; They loved
the Establishment, and, judging of it by its formularies,
identified it with the cause of evangelical religion.&nbsp; They
knew much less of <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Anglo-Catholic theology than of Puritanical works.&nbsp;
Owen and Baxter occupied a conspicuous place on their literary
shelves, by the side of Latimer and Calvin.&nbsp; The
Evangelicals were nevertheless faithful to their own
ecclesiastical order, preferring episcopacy to any other form of
government.&nbsp; Not on social or literary grounds had they
sympathy with Dissenters, or from what is now recognised as
&ldquo;breadth of opinion,&rdquo; but they cultivated union, on
purely evangelical grounds.</p>
<p>At our Bible Meeting, with good old Mr. Neale, other
evangelical clergymen were present, also one of our borough
members, Mr. Ramsbottom, M.P. (who always took the chair), and
Sir John Chapman, a strong conservative Churchman, was sure to be
on the platform.&nbsp; I cannot say that the speeches were
brilliant, though the deputation from London interested us
much.&nbsp; First came Mr. Dudley, who had been a Quaker, but was
then an Episcopalian; and, to the facts he detailed, there were
added peculiarities of utterance, which gave a flavour to what he
said.&nbsp; He slightly stuttered; and once, as he described how
the blind were taught to read with their fingers the pages of
embossed Bibles, he said it reminded him of the words,
&ldquo;That they should seek the Lord, if haply, they might
<i>feel after </i><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span><i>Him and find Him</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hesitation of
speech made the quotation increasingly effective.&nbsp; After him
came Mr. Bourne, who had, I believe, been formerly a stipendiary
magistrate in the West Indies; and he had a singular <i>click</i>
in his voice.&nbsp; He told a story of some ladies who had
coloured their maps so as to distinguish, by a pink colour, the
countries where the Bible was circulated&mdash;thus
&ldquo;<i>pinking</i> the world for Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The good
man&rsquo;s click told curiously on his pronunciation of words;
and I used, sometimes, to make my Bible Society friends smile, by
inquiring whether they offered a premium for agents with a
&ldquo;<i>diversity of tongues</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. Sydney
Godolphin Osborne&mdash;the famous &ldquo;S. G. O.&rdquo; of
<i>The Times</i> newspaper&mdash;had at that period a living near
Windsor, and took great interest in our auxiliary.&nbsp; He was a
fine, tall, aristocratic young man, of straightforward character,
strong common sense, and a racy style of utterance.&nbsp; He made
capital speeches, and in many ways helped on our work; in one way
especially, which deserves distinct mention.&nbsp; He thought it
would be a good thing to obtain royal patronage for our
auxiliary, though Her Majesty&rsquo;s name was not identified
with the parent society.&nbsp; He wrote to Lord John Russell,
then a Cabinet Minister (whose brother, <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Lord
Wriothesley Russell, after he became Canon of Windsor, lovingly
supported our cause).&nbsp; When Lord John laid the request
before Her Majesty, she graciously gave her name as local
patroness, and sent a donation of twenty guineas.&nbsp; It is
worth mentioning that this occurred at a time when party politics
were running high.&nbsp; Two letters communicating the
Queen&rsquo;s kindness may be here inserted.</p>
<p>The first was addressed to the Honourable Godolphin
Osborne.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter respecting &lsquo;The Windsor Auxiliary Bible
Society,&rsquo; on which the Queen was last year pleased to
bestow her patronage, which I have submitted to the Queen, and
though Her Majesty does not usually grant a donation to those
institutions to which Her Majesty&rsquo;s patronage only has been
given, yet, the Queen, taking into her consideration that the
establishment in question is in the immediate neighbourhood of
Windsor Castle, has been pleased to direct me to forward twenty
guineas as a donation.&nbsp; I beg to enclose a draft for that
sum, and request <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>you will have the goodness to acknowledge its
receipt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I have the honour to be,<br
/>
&ldquo;Your most obedient servant,<br />
&ldquo;H. <span class="smcap">Wheatley</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This letter was conveyed to me by the person addressed, who
added the following note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wrote to Sir H. Wheatley about a donation
from the Queen to the Bible Society.&nbsp; I have received a
satisfactory answer, and a draft for twenty guineas.&nbsp; If it
meets your approbation, I would wish that the fact should not be
known to any but ourselves just now.&nbsp; At the present moment
the country is so <i>party-mad</i>, and there is such a
determination to catch at anything for party purposes, that I am
anxious to avoid giving a handle of any sort to either side in a
matter which has no real reference to politics.&nbsp; I only
wrote last week from Wales, and got an immediate answer, which I
have acknowledged, saying, at the same time, that at the
anniversary meeting a more official acknowledgment will be
sent.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I remain,<br />
&ldquo;Yours truly,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Godolphin Osborne</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>This
letter sheds light on the state of public feeling existing at
that day.</p>
<p>In connection with the town of Windsor, let me mention two or
three traditions I received from the lips of my beloved wife, who
became the light of my dwelling on May 12th, 1835.&nbsp; Her good
old father, Mr. George Cooper, had long been a sort of Christian
Gaius, receiving as guests under his hospitable roof several men
and women of renown.&nbsp; Often would she speak of Rowland Hill,
who repeatedly visited her home on his way to Wotton-under-Edge,
where he spent the summer months.&nbsp; He delighted to preach in
our little chapel in High Street, where the Eton boys would
attend to see and hear the eccentric old clergyman, who in his
youth had been one of their predecessors as a schoolboy.&nbsp; He
would tell Mr. Cooper how he used sometimes to steal at eventide
beyond Eton bounds, to attend a prayer-meeting in a cottage,
which he could reach only by leaping over a ditch with the help
of a long pole.&nbsp; He allowed the good woman who lived there
an annuity, which Mr. Cooper used to convey as long as she
lived.&nbsp; Rowland Hill liked to hear at High Street Chapel the
Hundredth Psalm in Watts&rsquo;s Hymn-book, and the youngsters
who came used to alter the last <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>verse, shouting: &ldquo;When
<i>Rowland Hill</i> shall cease to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember hearing how Charles Wesley, the son of the great
hymn-writer, visited the town, accompanied by his sister, and
spent an evening in Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s house, greatly to the joy
of my wife as a girl.&nbsp; They arrived in a sedan chair,
dressed in Court costume.&nbsp; His execution on the piano was
surprising; and those who watched his thick, short fingers, as
they swept over the keys, said it was miraculous how he
played.</p>
<p>Before I conclude what I have to say of my life in Windsor,
let me advert to attempts I made to promote intellectual and
literary improvement, according to methods then beginning to be
popular.&nbsp; There was an Institute formed in the adjoining
town of Eton for the encouragement of reading amongst such as had
not enjoyed the advantages of early education.&nbsp; A room was
opened, furnished with a few books, where inducements to what is
termed mutual improvement were provided, and there the famous
astronomer Sir J. F. W. Herschell delivered an inaugural lecture,
which gave it at once a character of distinguished
respectability.&nbsp; I was invited to join in the infant
enterprise, which I did with pleasure and satisfaction, and felt
it an honour to <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>become one of its lecturers.&nbsp; The effort made at
Eton was followed at Windsor.&nbsp; I threw myself into the
enterprise, and worked on its behalf as long as I remained in the
town.&nbsp; The committee honoured me with an invitation to
lecture in the Town Hall, where my effort was kindly accepted by
a large audience; a short course on the History of the Castle and
Town followed.&nbsp; This, by request, was published in a volume
dedicated, by permission, to the Prince Consort.&nbsp; In its
preparation assistance had been furnished through books,
documents, and advice, by residents in the town, and by officials
in the castle.</p>
<p>In concluding this chapter, I am constrained to notice some
friendships which were enjoyed by me during my Windsor
residence.&nbsp; Poyle is a small hamlet on the Great Western
road not far from Windsor, near Colnbrook.&nbsp; Sixty years ago
a long line of mail coaches passed every night the turnpike-gate,
as cottagers heard the blast of the guard&rsquo;s horn, and
stepped out to see the coachmen, in like livery, handling the
reins which guided their teams.&nbsp; Hard by the spot there was
a paper mill, spanning a pretty little river, the Coln, which
kept the machinery in motion.&nbsp; The whole formed a picture
common in the early part of this century, <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>not so common
now.&nbsp; Close to the mill were two goodly residences, occupied
by two brothers named Ibotson, of an old Nonconformist stock, who
could trace back religious ancestors to Puritan days.&nbsp; What
pleasant gatherings of congenial friends I met with at
Poyle!&mdash;neighbouring pastors, and the Rev. Joshua Clarkson
Harrison, born not far off, and at the time building up a goodly
reputation in London and its environs, were of the number.</p>
<p>In contrast with these bright circumstances, I must notice
incidents of a far different kind.&nbsp; My dear wife lost about
that time two brothers in early life by what we call accidents;
but, worse still, while I was from home one summer, my beloved
mother, who lived with me, set fire to her muslin dress, while
the servant was absent, and immediately became enveloped in
flames.&nbsp; Some one passing by endeavoured to render
assistance, but it was too late, and the next morning she
expired.&nbsp; Bright summer weather was for a long time after
that, to my eyes, covered with a pall of darkness; and to look on
the blue sky and the gay summer flowers only made me more
sad.</p>
<h2><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
1837&ndash;1843</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> disposed beyond immediate
pastoral duties to help in religious work outside, I found ample
opportunities for doing it.&nbsp; Sir Culling Eardley was at that
time zealous in the furtherance of village preaching.&nbsp;
Coming to Windsor, he offered to help us in purchasing a tent for
services in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It was procured and
employed, but with less success than had attended his enterprise
of the same kind in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; I undertook, at his
request, a fortnight&rsquo;s tour in that county, and one evening
preached near a wood, where John Bunyan, in days of persecution,
addressed the neglected peasantry.</p>
<p>Revivalism at the period now referred to, attracted attention
in England, in part owing to the circulation of American books,
and the preaching of American divines.&nbsp; A great awakening
occurred at <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Reading, Henley, Maidenhead, and Windsor.&nbsp; Streams
of people might be seen on dark winter mornings, lantern in hand,
on their way to the place of prayer.&nbsp; Chapels were thronged,
ministers were in full sympathy with each other; all worked with
a will.&nbsp; Looking back on the whole, I believe genuine good
was done; yet in some instances the effect was transient.&nbsp;
Conversion was insisted upon, and peace with God through Jesus
Christ was offered; but whether moral improvement in the details
of human life was proportionally emphasised, and practically
carried out, I am not prepared to say.&nbsp; Certainly, appeals
respecting holiness in general were not wanting.&nbsp; Rightly to
adjust the balance, so as to guard against self-righteousness on
one hand, and the neglect of personal responsibility on the
other, requires vast wisdom.&nbsp; To induce people to look at
themselves and to Christ also, cannot be accomplished without
thought and discrimination in promiscuous gatherings.&nbsp;
Whatever might be defects in the movement, assuredly they did not
come from artificial arrangements.&nbsp; No one can be said to
have &ldquo;got up the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At all times in the course of our ministry &ldquo;cases of
conscience&rdquo; occur.&nbsp; One in particular I may
mention.&nbsp; I was once sent for to visit a dying <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>person.&nbsp;
The home, the people, the surroundings, excited revulsion, as
well as a determination to improve a strange opportunity.&nbsp; I
found a young woman on her deathbed, and another sitting by, who
used phraseology indicative of evangelical sentiment.&nbsp; She
offered to leave the room that the patient might unburthen her
mind to me.&nbsp; It was obvious some secret of guilt lay on the
sufferer&rsquo;s conscience.&nbsp; I had no wish to be a father
confessor, and pointed her to the <i>only One</i> who can pardon
sin.&nbsp; At last the dying creature uttered a piercing
exclamation, which seemed to me an acknowledgment of sin.&nbsp;
What the secret was she did not disclose.&nbsp; Presently she
entered &ldquo;the silent land.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I called again,
I intimated to her attendant my surprise at what she had said,
for I could not doubt that she was leading an immoral life.&nbsp;
She frankly confessed she had fallen into vice, after expressing
a belief that she had been converted, and <i>had</i> been a
&ldquo;child of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The incident was affecting,
instructive, and admonitory.</p>
<p>Public questions interested me much, and I took part in those
which belonged to philanthropy and religion.&nbsp; Amongst them
at the time I speak of, negro emancipation stood foremost.&nbsp;
From boyhood it laid hold on me.&nbsp; Speeches at <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Norwich, by
Joseph John Gurney and others, had left an abiding impression;
and when the great controversy became ripe for settlement, I
threw myself into the struggle.&nbsp; The excitement throughout
the nation was intense, and it laid hold chiefly of the religious
section of the British public.&nbsp; Missionaries had been at
work amongst negroes, and had seen the horrors of the
system.&nbsp; The persecution of Smith, a missionary in Demerara,
who died in prison, evoked passionate sympathy; and the appeal of
Knibb, another missionary, who came over as an advocate of
emancipation, struck the nail on the head, and drove it into the
centre of this colossal wrong.&nbsp; Nothing is more manifest, to
those who witnessed what went on in England half a century ago
for slave emancipation, than that, however manifold the arguments
employed, however numerous the methods and agencies in motion, it
was Christianity which lay at the heart of the movement.&nbsp;
Quakers were amongst the most zealous co-operators in this
advocacy for freedom, and I much enjoyed the fellowship into
which I was brought with followers of George Fox, early family
associations strengthening bonds of friendship between us.&nbsp;
Deputations went up to London to wait upon Mr. Stanley, Colonial
Secretary, afterwards <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Earl of Derby, and I well remember
the crowd gathered in a large room in Downing Street, to
strengthen the hands of that gentleman in his chivalrous
enterprise.&nbsp; The history of steps which led to the final
victory it is not for me to tell in these pages, but I may
mention the third reading by the Lords of the Emancipation Bill
in August 1833.&nbsp; It filled multitudes with joy; and on
August 1st, 1834, the Act took effect, when a solemn celebration
of the event occurred in England, as well as the West India
Islands.&nbsp; That day I preached at Windsor from Jer. xl.
4:&mdash;&ldquo;And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the
chains which were upon thine hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1839 the Anti-Corn Law League took shape.&nbsp; I
distinctly recollect the scene presented at a great bazaar in
Covent Garden Theatre, in aid of Free Trade, when there was a
wonderful gathering of notabilities and other folks.&nbsp;
Stalls, articles, and ornaments, were varied and imposing; and as
that exhibition appeared before the present age of bazaars was
fully inaugurated, it had a more dazzling and bewildering effect
than efforts of the kind can have now that they have become so
common.</p>
<p>Dissenters&rsquo; grievances, too, were exciting subjects in
those days.&nbsp; Certain disabilities had an irritating <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>effect on
those who felt them, and legislation was sought for their
removal.&nbsp; No doubt, in the heat of the conflict things were
said on both sides which, on calm review, cannot be justified;
and I am in my old age more than ever convinced that union of the
<i>suaviter in modo</i> with the <i>fortiter in re</i>, is the
best method of conducting controversy.</p>
<p>My holidays, whilst I was a Windsor pastor, were spent in
preaching; but there were two exceptions, when I broke ground as
a tourist.&nbsp; Travelling in Nottinghamshire and the
neighbouring counties, I visited Newstead Abbey with a fresh
remembrance of Washington Irving&rsquo;s description of the
place.&nbsp; I had a gossip with an old domestic, who told me
stories of Lord Byron, whom she knew as a boy, and used to carry
on her back on account of his lameness.&nbsp; He pricked and
otherwise tormented the patient creature, so as, on one occasion,
to provoke her so much, that she boldly ventured on a rather
amusing act of retaliation.&nbsp; Leaning over her shoulders to
look into an old chest full of feathers, she, to use her own
words, &ldquo;copped him over, and he came out for all the world
just like a young owlet.&rdquo;&nbsp; What I then heard of his
early days gave me an unfavourable idea of that child of genius,
so caressed and tormented, so flattered and persecuted, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>so early
thrown into unfortunate circumstances, and altogether so badly
brought up.&nbsp; What a contrast between two poets, whose
memories came vividly before me during this tour!&mdash;Byron and
Scott, both of them lame for life; one a stranger to the
other&rsquo;s purity.&nbsp; Years afterwards I heard Dean Stanley
preach a sermon to children, in which, with his characteristic
felicity of thought, he spoke of the contrasted influences of
physical deformity in these two instances&mdash;how the club foot
of the first was an occasion of mortified pride and ill-nature,
and the club foot of the second was borne with patience and
contentment.&nbsp; The story of Byron&rsquo;s club foot is now
treated by some I hear as a popular delusion; but, at all events,
he had something the matter with his foot which irritated his
temper and made him disagreeable.&nbsp; Therefore the
Dean&rsquo;s moral lesson remains untouched.&nbsp; In connection
with good humour and kindness, a physical defect may be only a
foil to set off moral excellence.</p>
<p>After passing through Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland in
company with my dear friend Harrison, we reached Edinburgh by
coach at midnight to find ourselves in the morning amidst grand
preparations for the Queen&rsquo;s first arrival in the Scottish
capital.&nbsp; The view at noon from Calton <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Hill, as the
arrangements for receiving royalty had reached their acme, was
most magnificent.&nbsp; Princes Street, from end to end,
presented multitudes of people in holiday attire, military
uniforms, tartan, kilts and feathered bonnets, gave rich plays of
colour.&nbsp; The crowd waited and waited, but no Queen
appeared.&nbsp; Night fell, and the expectants went to bed
disappointed.&nbsp; Next morning every one was taken by surprise,
for Her Majesty, having been detained at sea, landed at Leith,
whilst the Lord Provost was still asleep.&nbsp; My friend and I
afterwards went to Stirling, and identified historic points which
dot the field of Bannockburn&mdash;then to Perth, Dunkeld,
Killiecrankie, and Blair Atholl.</p>
<p>In the course of numerous journeys I had opportunities of
seeing the real state of Nonconformity in rural districts.&nbsp;
It was then much better than some people suppose.&nbsp; There
were then families of influence identified with country places of
worship, who have not left behind them sympathetic
representatives.&nbsp; The revival of religion in the National
Church has produced a considerable change in the relative
position of ecclesiastical parties.&nbsp; Sunday evening services
in cathedral and parish church, and the pastoral activity of
incumbents and curates, with numerous missionary and other
organisations, <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>have produced effects very visible in the eyes of old
people, who can look back on the religious condition of England
during the first quarter of the present century.</p>
<p>My first Continental tour occurred before I left
Windsor.&nbsp; I visited a family at Rotterdam into which a
fellow-student had married, and had pleasant insights into Dutch
life.&nbsp; After peeps at the Hague, Leyden, and Amsterdam,
abounding in a gratification of antiquarian and historical taste,
slowly proceeding up the Rhine, I felt all the enthusiasm
incident to a young traveller as he first gazes on castle-crowned
hills which line the river.&nbsp; Many and many a ramble since on
those romantic banks have increased rather than diminished my
admiration of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Friendships have through life been essential to my enjoyment,
I might almost say to my existence.&nbsp; Intimate acquaintance
with people of remarkable character in my Windsor days was a
source of intense gratification.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. Walford, for some years minister of a
Congregational Church at Yarmouth, then classical tutor at
Homerton College, and finally pastor of the old Meeting House,
Uxbridge, was one of the most remarkable men I ever knew.&nbsp; I
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>see him
now, with his handsome face, bald head, well-knit form, keen
eyes, compressed lips, rather tottering in gait, and brusque in
manner.&nbsp; What walks and talks we had!&nbsp; In conversation
he expressed himself with singular accuracy on theological and
metaphysical subjects.&nbsp; He had Butler and Jonathan Edwards
at his fingers&rsquo; ends, and could pack into a few words some
of their most abstruse definitions and arguments.&nbsp; He had a
habit of turning round when you walked with him, and standing
face to face, when he would, in a most luminous style, state his
propositions and adduce his proofs.&nbsp; He read Sir William
Hamilton with immense admiration, though he did not in all
respects adopt his views; and, at a period when looseness of
religious thought was becoming prevalent, it was a treat to see
him make a stand, figuratively as well as literally, for a
distinct utterance of what people believe.&nbsp; From no
man&rsquo;s conversation have I derived more instruction and
advantage.&nbsp; I can never forget his reading to me, with tears
in his eyes, a translation he had made of Plato&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Phaedo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day an old gentleman called to say he was about to reside
at Old Windsor, and intended joining our worship at William
Street Chapel.&nbsp; He had a <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>cheerful, lively expression of
countenance, with a few short grey locks on each side of his bald
head, and showed in his gait signs of paralytic seizure.&nbsp;
Full of humour and kindness, he made a pleasant impression.&nbsp;
Thus began my friendship with Mr. Samuel Bagster of famous
Polyglot memory.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his lameness, he could at
that time walk from Old Windsor to our house with the aid of a
stick, only asking a helping hand at the commencement of his
pedestrian attempts.&nbsp; Thus started off he would steadily
pursue his journey dressed in a short cloak and wearing a very
broad-brimmed hat.&nbsp; He was one of the chattiest, most
amusing friends I ever had.&nbsp; He possessed a large fund of
anecdotes, which he knew I liked; and from time to time, as I
visited his house, he doled them out with no niggard hand.&nbsp;
He had lived on books, and books were his delight.&nbsp; Many
choice editions in handsome bindings lined the walls in his
rambling, quaint sort of residence, where also flowers, gathered
in his little garden, formed conspicuous ornaments.&nbsp; There
he would sit nursing his foot, complaining of pain in his great
toe, and would launch out for a pleasant sail over the lake of
memory, and take me from one point to another.&nbsp; The old
books he had bought and sold, the <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>circumstances connected with the
origin of his Polyglot and Hexapla, the fire which occurred on
his premises in Paternoster Row&mdash;these he would narrate in a
characteristic way.</p>
<p>He often talked about the French Revolution and events
connected with it in our own country.&nbsp; Clubs of a more than
questionable description were established, and he told me that,
invited by a person of his own age to attend a meeting held in an
obscure street, he was surprised, on his entrance, to find a
number of men ranged on either side of a room, sitting by long
tables, with a cross one at the upper end.&nbsp; There sat the
president for the evening.&nbsp; Several foaming tankards were
brought in, when the president calling on the company to rise,
took up one of the pots, and striking off the foam which crested
the porter, gave as a toast: &ldquo;So let all . . .
perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; The blank was left to be filled up as each
drinker pleased.&nbsp; The avowed dislike to kings entertained by
these boon companions suggested to Mr. Bagster the word
&ldquo;kings&rdquo; or &ldquo;tyrants&rdquo;; and at once he
gladly left the place, not a little alarmed, lest he should be
suspected of treasonable designs.&nbsp; With characteristic
caution, he took care not to observe the thoroughfare through
which he passed on his way back, that he might be able
conscientiously <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>to declare he did not know the situation of the
place.&nbsp; He also related that his father had a workman in his
employ, whom he knew to be a disaffected subject.&nbsp; He
expostulated with him on the horrors of a revolution as
illustrated in France, and dwelt upon the confusion which would
ensue upon outbreaks on established order.&nbsp; The man lifted
up the skirt of his threadbare coat against the window, and
significantly asked: &ldquo;Pray, sir, what have I to
lose?&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend was no Radical, no Whig, but a Tory
of the old-fashioned type, who approved of things as they were,
without, however, any consciousness of wishing to tyrannise over
other people.&nbsp; He was a great admirer of Izaak Walton, and
had made a collection of drawings illustrative of his
&ldquo;Compleat Angler,&rdquo; of which he intended to publish a
new edition, with a life of the author.&nbsp; When he had
completed his &ldquo;Comprehensive Bible,&rdquo; which, by
permission, he dedicated to George IV., he was allowed personally
to present it to His Majesty; and I have heard him say that on
that occasion he was introduced to the royal presence by the
Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; The publisher was already
paralysed, and could walk only with a tottering step; but the
Primate gave him his arm, and led him up to the so-called first
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>gentleman
of Europe, who received him very graciously, and accepted at his
hands the handsomely-bound volume.</p>
<p>There were other people I met with at Windsor whom I may
mention.&nbsp; At the house of Dr. Ferguson, a Scotch physician
of good birth and high culture, I met with his son-in-law, the
Rev. Mr. Moultrie, Incumbent at Rugby, and friend of Dr.
Arnold.&nbsp; He was a man of genius and piety, and gave a
conviction of personal goodness, which made me value his volume
of poems even more than I had done before.&nbsp; I like to look
at authors through their books, and then again at books through
their authors.&nbsp; In some cases the personal damages the
literary judgment; but in many cases I have enjoyed works much
more after knowing the worker.</p>
<p>Mr. Jesse, the naturalist, was another of my
acquaintances.&nbsp; He held an office in connection with royal
parks and palaces, and I spent pleasant hours as he drove me in
his little pony gig from Windsor to Hampton Court, in the
restoration of which he felt great delight.&nbsp; An amiable
disposition, gentlemanly manners, and large information, made him
an excellent companion.&nbsp; From the account he gave of his
early life I found his father was a <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>clergyman, a friend of Lady
Huntingdon&rsquo;s, and an occasional preacher at Spafields
Chapel.&nbsp; Mr. Stark, the eminent landscape artist, was one of
my hearers, a man of decided religious convictions, and
conscientious in art as in other things.&nbsp; He and Mr.
Bristow, the animal painter, were amongst my friends; and in
Windsor Forest they found subjects for their united skill, Stark
putting in the trees, Bristow dogs and horses.</p>
<p>Amongst London friends at that time, and long afterwards was
John Bergne, brother to my fellow-student Samuel Bergne, already
mentioned.&nbsp; Clerk in the Foreign Office, he rose to the
superintendence of the Treaty Department.&nbsp; Full of knowledge
respecting European affairs, he often amused me by his
taciturnity whenever they came on the carpet,&mdash;abstinence
from communication of office secrets having become to him second
nature.&nbsp; His mind was rich with information on various
subjects; and in the science of numismatics he was well
skilled.&nbsp; His collection of coins was of great value,
including examples of English money from the earliest time, and
valuable portions of &ldquo;great finds&rdquo; in Greek
states.&nbsp; His affluent conversation, overflowing with humour,
his rapid utterance and command of language surpassed what I have
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>heard from
many good talkers, whom it has been my fortune to meet with
during a long life.</p>
<p>With other remarkable persons, I became intimately acquainted
after my removal to Kensington.&nbsp; These I shall notice in
their proper place.</p>
<p>In 1833 arose the Puseyite or Tractarian controversy as it was
called.&nbsp; Of this a full account is given by Dr. Newman, in
his &ldquo;Apologia&rdquo;&mdash;an account, of course,
proceeding from his own point of view.&nbsp; The strife both
inside and outside the University of Oxford, where the masters of
the Tractarian movement lived and worked, was of the hottest
kind; and those engaged in it on both sides, under the influence
of party feeling, failed to appreciate each other&rsquo;s
position, and to estimate correctly the tendencies
involved.&nbsp; The Anglo-Catholics did not believe they were so
near Rome; the staunch Protestants did not calculate on the
wonderful effect which the controversy would have in stirring up
the latent energies of the Church, and in modifying forms of
worship, even amongst Evangelical parties.&nbsp; An amusing story
I remember hearing when the famous Tract, &ldquo;No. 90,&rdquo;
was published.&nbsp; The then Bishop of Winchester (I think)
wished to see it, and wrote to his bookseller to forward a copy,
but from illegibility of penmanship <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>&ldquo;<i>No</i> 90&rdquo; was
mistaken for &ldquo;<i>No go</i>&rdquo;; and the poor bookseller,
after inquiring in the Row for a pamphlet with that title, wrote
to inform his Lordship, that there was no such tract in the
market.&nbsp; The story ran its round, and the Evangelicals
pronounced &ldquo;<i>No.</i> 90&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>No
go</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Newman condensed within the space of a few years the
Romeward tendencies of Christendom during successive ages:
starting with Tractarian doctrines, it was consistent for him to
become a Roman Catholic in the sequel; and Dr. Pusey, in pausing
where he did, never explained the grounds of his practical
inconsistency.&nbsp; I felt it my duty to point out the
unscriptural character of the Tractarian movement in a course of
lectures, afterwards published under the title of
&ldquo;Tractarian Theology.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>CHAPTER V<br />
1843&ndash;1850</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> quite satisfied with my
position at Windsor and had no thoughts of leaving it, when Dr.
Vaughan of Kensington accepted the principalship of Lancashire
College, and at the same time overtures were made by his Church
to me that I should succeed him in the vacant pastorate.&nbsp; I
can truly say that my desires were on the side of remaining where
I was.&nbsp; I only wished to know the Divine Master&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; I felt unwilling to accept what looked like
preferment; but after visiting Kensington and preaching there,
the path before me appeared pretty plain.&nbsp; I accepted the
call I received.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems like a dream,&rdquo; I
wrote to my predecessor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;but it is like Joseph&rsquo;s&mdash;a dream from the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a curious coincidence that the Church at Windsor and
the Church at Kensington were both in their origin connected with
a coachman in the <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>service of George III.&nbsp; His name was Saunders, and
he enjoyed his royal master&rsquo;s confidence.&nbsp; They used
to talk together about religion, and, encouraged by the
King&rsquo;s good opinion, the servant put tracts in the carriage
pocket; and when His Majesty had read them he asked for
more.&nbsp; As the royal residence was sometimes in town, and
sometimes at Windsor, the home of Saunders varied accordingly,
and he felt an interest in both neighbourhoods, especially as it
regarded the humbler class.&nbsp; He probably caught the
revivalist spirit prevalent a hundred years ago, and did what he
could to gather people together for religious impression.&nbsp;
In this way a room called &ldquo;The Hole in the Wall&rdquo; came
to be the cradle of Windsor Congregationalism; and a
&ldquo;humble dwelling,&rdquo; mentioned by the Kensington
historian, was birthplace to the congregation which afterwards
assembled in Hornton Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the faithful
servant begged permission, on account of age, to retire from His
Majesty&rsquo;s service, that he might reside at Kensington, it
was not without an expression of regret on the part of the
monarch; but the request was granted, and as often as the King
afterwards passed through the place he took the most kind and
condescending notice of his coachman.&rdquo; <a
name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a></p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>In
&ldquo;Poems by John Moultrie,&rdquo; there occur these
lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have a son, a third sweet son, his age I
cannot tell,<br />
For they reckon not by years and months where he is gone to
dwell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the first three years of my Kensington residence, there
were three little children taken from us, and translated to that
mysterious world, where our time reckonings are lost in an
incomprehensible eternity.&nbsp; Altogether six children were
brought with us from Windsor; and to these were added five more
in the first few years after our removal&mdash;making the
domestic flock at the time I speak of eleven.&nbsp; Of that
number only four remain on earth at this time, <a
name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a>&mdash;a fact which tells of joy, and of
much sorrow, at the hands of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; Three
were taken from us between 1843 and 1849.</p>
<p>During my Windsor life I began to take a deep interest in the
writings of Dr. Arnold, and afterwards, when his Life appeared,
written by his admiring pupil, Dr. Stanley, that interest
increased.&nbsp; As I read these memoirs I little thought that I
should share in the Biographer&rsquo;s friendship; and my
admiration of the two men was so deep that I attribute any
improvement <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>in my mind and character since, greatly to their
combined influence.&nbsp; Through life I have been more than
ordinarily benefited by their works, and as to the Master of
Rugby School, I have always been eager to learn what I could from
any Rugby pupils I happened to know.&nbsp; At this moment there
comes to my recollection an anecdote related by a friend who had
been a Rugby boy.&nbsp; He told me that some accident happened at
chapel in the upsetting of Bibles or prayer-books, and their fall
from the gallery created much disturbance.&nbsp; Boys who were
suspected of having a share in causing what happened were called
up by the Master, and my informant was of the number.&nbsp; He
told me that Dr. Arnold <i>trusted</i> a boy who denied any
offence of which he was accused until clear proof appeared to the
contrary.&nbsp; This was designed to keep up mutual
confidence.&nbsp; In the instance under notice the boy accused
felt sure that Dr. Arnold was not satisfied with the denial; yet
he allowed the matter to pass, because he would promote
confidence between master and pupil.&nbsp; The anecdote confirms
what I have since read.&nbsp; He was never on the watch for boys,
and he so encouraged straightforward and manly action, in trivial
as in great things, that there grew up a general feeling, that
&ldquo;It <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>was a shame to tell Arnold a lie, for he always believed
one.&rdquo; <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a></p>
<p>Kensington, at the time of which I speak, was famous for its
number of ladies&rsquo; schools, and in them several daughters of
Nonconformist parents were receiving their education.&nbsp; They
formed an interesting part of my congregation, and my pastoral
relation to them prepared for lifelong friendships.&nbsp; Of this
group of families were the Dawsons of Lancaster, the Rawsons of
Leeds, the Cheethams of Staleybridge, and the Sharmans of
Wellingborough.&nbsp; With all of them I became intimate, and
their friendships have proved no small comfort to me in later
life.&nbsp; Parents of these families were distinguished by
usefulness in many ways.&nbsp; Mr. Rawson was the well-known
gifted hymn-writer; and Mr. Cheetham was M.P., and took an active
part in the repeal of the Corn Laws.&nbsp; Daughters of these
gentlemen were under my ministerial care while pupils at
Kensington, and afterwards became earnest Christian workers in
different ways, and their continued affection is a comfort to me
in my old age.&nbsp; A son of Mr. Dawson married a daughter of
Mr. Rawson, and immediately they went to China for mission work;
but the broken-down <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>health of the husband compelled his speedy return to
England.&nbsp; He is now doing good work as one of the London
City Mission secretaries.</p>
<p>In connection with Kensington, I would further mention other
helpers: Mr. and Mrs. Coombs of Clapham were so.&nbsp; Mr. Coombs
helped me especially by a large donation to the fund for building
my new chapel.&nbsp; In other ways I was brought into relation
with him.&nbsp; He was Treasurer of New College, and an active
member of the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Religious
Tract Society, and the London Missionary Society.&nbsp; His
intelligence, aptitude for conversation, and kind-hearted
intercourse made his friendship a privilege of more than ordinary
value.&nbsp; It was intensified by his family relationship to
some of my Kensington flock, the Salters and the Talfourds, whom
I shall mention elsewhere in these reminiscences.&nbsp; Amidst
preaching and pastoral work, it was a relief to spend a short
holiday under Mr. Coombs&rsquo; hospitable roof at Clapham, where
I found a large collection of books.&nbsp; He died before I left
Kensington, but my friendship with his wife and daughter
continued till they died.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Sinclair, who had accepted the vicarage just before
I removed to Kensington, paid me a <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>visit of welcome, and thus laid a
foundation for subsequent intercourse.&nbsp; He was son of the
well-known Sir John Sinclair, and brother of the authoress,
Catherine Sinclair.&nbsp; All the family were remarkably
tall.&nbsp; The Archdeacon was a man of eminent culture, and of
extensive aristocratic connections.&nbsp; His great-grandmother,
though a loyalist, was the noted lady who aided in the escape of
Prince Charlie, after the battle of Culloden.&nbsp; This same
ancestress lay buried in Kensington Church, in front of the
pulpit.&nbsp; Archdeacon Sinclair was well read in theology,
widely acquainted with the controversies of the day, and a
thoroughly orthodox Churchman; also rich in family and Scotch
traditions.&nbsp; He told me the MSS. of David Hume came into his
hands, and from perusal of them he was confirmed in his
suspicion, that the celebrated historian and philosopher had no
deep convictions of any kind, but only played with subjects he
handled, doubtful about his own doubts.</p>
<p>Returning to the notice of my ministerial life, it comes in
chronological order to mention that we had at Kensington, in
1843, British schools, which, being undenominational, received
help from Church-people and Dissenters.&nbsp; They had long been
patronised by distinguished personages, and not <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>long after I
had become resident in the neighbourhood application was made by
the committee to the Duchess of Inverness, widow of the Duke of
Sussex, to become patroness of the schools.&nbsp; This
circumstance led her Grace to invite me to call on her, which I
did.&nbsp; I was shown into an old-fashioned drawing-room,
furnished in the style of the last century, the walls being
decorated with portraits of George III. and members of his
family.&nbsp; Entering the apartment was stepping back, as it
were, to &ldquo;sixty years since.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old lady of
diminutive stature, in black silk and a small cap, presently
appeared, who entered into pleasant conversation about her late
husband, and Mr. Ramsbottom, M.P. for Windsor, whom I knew very
well.&nbsp; Both of them were zealous Freemasons.&nbsp; Her Grace
had caught their spirit, as far as a lady could do it, and
inquired of me whether I was a Mason.&nbsp; No doubt, could I
have answered in the affirmative, I should have risen in her
estimation.&nbsp; My visit was fruitful in reference to our
schools, for she sent a donation of &pound;20, apologising for
not doing more at that time.&nbsp; Kensington Palace was then
inhabited by other distinguished persons; and one of the
secretaries of the Propagation Society, I think, at that time
performed <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>the duties of a chaplain to those resident within the
walls.</p>
<p>It is appropriate in connection with the early part of my
Kensington life to mention religious societies with which I
closely associated myself.&nbsp; There is no doubt some truth in
the lines that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Distance lends enchantment to the view,<br
/>
And clothes the mountain with an azure hue.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In looking at benevolent work, remote in time or place, we are
apt to paint it in fairest colours; but of the great importance
of the religious work going on fifty years ago in London and the
neighbourhood, there can be no question whatever.</p>
<p>The <i>British and Foreign Bible Society</i> I always regarded
as lying at the very foundation of our religious activity.&nbsp;
It had a comprehensive Auxiliary in the West End from the
commencement of the society&rsquo;s operations, and annual
meetings were held in the Haymarket, under the presidency of
royal dukes.&nbsp; This Auxiliary was broken into parts, and
Kensington had a leading place amongst them.&nbsp; Traditions of
earlier days were cherished when I began to live in the royal
suburb, and they invested our local gatherings with some dignity,
as families when divided derive honours from their common
ancestry.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>The
Missionary Society, as it was originally called&mdash;the
<i>London Missionary Society</i>, as it was afterwards
named&mdash;had from the beginning been supported by our Church;
indeed, fathers and founders of the one appear amongst early
workers in the other, and through the ministry of Mr. Clayton,
Dr. Leifchild, and Dr. Vaughan, foreign missions found zealous
supporters at Kensington.&nbsp; The London City Mission, then in
its early age, had engaged my sympathies at Windsor.&nbsp; There
we had a town missionary, who brought us into connection with
work going on in the Metropolis.&nbsp; Consequently, when I came
to Kensington, I took much interest in the annual meetings of the
society, and was brought into intimate relations with its
officers and supporters.&nbsp; Annual gatherings were held in
Freemasons&rsquo; Hall, Queen Street, where signs of the Zodiac,
and portraits of Grand Masters, adorned the ceiling and walls,
suggesting to speakers allusions, obvious or far-fetched, till
they became rather threadbare and wearisome; but, from the
beginning, narratives by the missionaries formed a chief source
of interest.</p>
<p>The Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association was formed soon
after I came to my new charge, and with it I had connection from
the beginning, being first on <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>the list of lecturers in the City,
before the annual courses at Exeter Hall commenced.</p>
<p>The Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1843, and as a desire
for union has ever been with me a &ldquo;passion,&rdquo; I joined
the Alliance from the beginning.&nbsp; There was great simplicity
in the earliest gatherings, and an air of novelty gave additional
charms.&nbsp; However, some members professing catholic
sympathies on the platform pursued an exclusive line of conduct
on other occasions, and this circumstance provoked unfavourable
comments.&nbsp; Plausible objections, moreover, were made to the
society&rsquo;s constitution&mdash;the platform, too wide for
some, being too narrow for others.&nbsp; I could have desired a
wider basis and the furtherance of Christian unity apart from all
controversy with those who differed from us.&nbsp; On the whole,
however, it was a move in the right direction, and the gatherings
of its early friends in town and in other parts of the country
were of an eminently joyous description.&nbsp; Sir Culling
Eardley and others, in private as well as public, promoted the
interests of the Alliance.&nbsp; At that time several influential
clergymen and leading Dissenters used to meet, not only on the
platform, but in the homes of distinguished lay members, who
threw themselves very heartily into the movement.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Brought
into the neighbourhood of London, and already known by some
brethren there, I soon found myself surrounded by many
friends.&nbsp; For more than a century there had been in
existence an association of Dissenting ministers, who took the
title of <i>Sub Rosa</i>, from the confidential character of
their intercourse.&nbsp; There were some of the most
distinguished London Congregational ministers in the brotherhood
at the time now referred to; and they discussed points of
importance, and for the most part, as to denominational matters,
acted in harmony.&nbsp; Some of the departed were men of great
ability, conspicuous in the pulpit and on the platform; but the
remembrance of them by the public is being gradually crowded out
by new names and new questions of religious interest.</p>
<p>To turn to a very different subject, which synchronises with
the period under review; let me notice that the month of October
1845 witnessed the stirring event of Newman&rsquo;s secession to
the Church of Rome.&nbsp; It was an event of singular
importance.&nbsp; I have noticed on a previous page that the
Tractarian Movement was regarded by many as distinctly tending in
the direction of Romanism.&nbsp; For a considerable time such a
tendency was denied on the part of its abettors generally; yet,
even as early <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>as November, 1835, Dr. Pusey, who had such confidence in
Newman, wrote to his wife: &ldquo;I almost see elements of
disunion, in that John Newman will scare people&rdquo;; <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a> and, in 1836, Newman himself
incidentally wrote: &ldquo;As to the sacrificial view of the
Eucharist, I do not see that you can find fault with the formal
wording of the Tridentine decree.&nbsp; Does not the Article on
the sacrifice of the Mass supply the doctrine, or notion, to be
opposed?&nbsp; What that is, is to be learnt historically, I
suppose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides the question of Eucharistic
doctrine, Pusey&rsquo;s correspondence at this time gives clear
evidence of other questions, more or less difficult, in respect
to doctrine, practice, or terminology, arising out of a more
general appreciation of Church principles and order. <a
name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a>&nbsp; That which was called Puseyism
prepared for Popery; and this was obvious to most people, though
Pusey himself could not see it.&nbsp; Inconsistently, as I think,
he remained where he was; and, now that he declined to follow his
friend, it is surprising he took no steps to satisfy the public
as to grounds on which he himself remained in the Church of
England.&nbsp; His attachment to what he deemed the Church of his
fathers, however, was <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>very strong, and he thought well of
those who remained in that Church, though holding opinions
different from his own.&nbsp; For instance, he wrote: &ldquo;Ever
since I knew them, which was not in my earliest years,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have loved those who are called
<i>Evangelicals</i>.&nbsp; I loved them because they loved our
Lord.&nbsp; I loved them for their zeal for souls.&nbsp; I often
thought them narrow, yet I was often drawn to individuals among
them, more than to others who held truths in common with myself,
which the Evangelicals did not hold, at least not
explicitly.&rdquo; <a name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a>&nbsp; There is a ring in these words
which shows the sympathy which Pusey retained for those who loved
the Saviour, though, in ecclesiastical matters, widely differing
from High Churchmen.&nbsp; It appears to me that, if Pusey had
been as <i>consistent</i> with his Tractarian principles as
Newman was, Pusey would have followed Newman to Rome, but,
happily, his loving spirit for Christian <i>goodness</i> kept him
in communion with a Church where he saw piety beautifully
manifested by some who differed from him in ecclesiastical
opinion.&nbsp; I cannot make this reference to Dr. Pusey without
saying that, with all my repugnance to his <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>ecclesiastical opinions, and the conviction I have, that
while he never became a Romanist, he greatly helped on the
movement which carried many in the popish direction, the perusal
of his memoirs has given me a high estimate of his personal
piety.&nbsp; His devoutness, his love to Christ, his unworldly
habits, his affectionate disposition, and his self-denial in the
ordering of his domestic affairs, so as to enlarge his pecuniary
contributions to religious purposes, are worthy of their
imitation who regard with sorrow his High-Church
peculiarities.&nbsp; Might not domestic and social ties, as well
as strong attachment to the Church of England from his childhood,
have had something to do with his final course?</p>
<p>The Revolutions of 1848 brought with them an immense amount of
excitement in this country, as in others.&nbsp; The month of
April in that year can never be forgotten.&nbsp; An outbreak was
feared in London.&nbsp; Special constables were sworn in.&nbsp;
On the Sunday before the 10th of the month my friend, Mr.
Walford, preached a remarkable sermon in Kensington Chapel.&nbsp;
His text was Isa. xii. 2&mdash;&ldquo;Behold, God is my
salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having
unfolded the sentiment of the passage, he applied the principle
to passing events, <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>and spoke of the political excitement in this country at
the time of the French Revolution, which he well
remembered.&nbsp; He assured us that the excitement then
surpassed anything which existed at the time when he spoke, and
expressed his confidence in the rectitude and love of the
Almighty, who maketh the wrath of man to praise Him.&nbsp; The
preacher&rsquo;s age, and his vivid recollection of what he had
witnessed, gave force to his exhortations, as tears were falling
from his eyes.</p>
<p>Trust in Providence, touchingly enforced by personal
recollections, was honoured by what occurred on the following
day.&nbsp; The meeting on Kensington Common, so much dreaded,
broke up in confusion.&nbsp; Ringleaders were alarmed, the mob
was scattered without the interference of soldiers who had been
provided against an outbreak, but were concealed in public
buildings, through the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s wisdom.&nbsp; A
day which opened in fear was spent in peace and confidence.</p>
<p>During a visit abroad in that year, 1848, I reached Geneva,
with letters of introduction to C&aelig;sar Malan, Gaussen, and
M. St. George.&nbsp; Merle D&rsquo;Aubigne was from home.&nbsp;
In company with friends, on the Sunday afternoon, I attended at
C&aelig;sar Malan&rsquo;s little chapel.&nbsp; We had mistaken
the <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>hour,
and, on our entering, he recapitulated the early portions of his
sermon.&nbsp; Then, in his own pleasant parlour, he engaged in
fervent discourse on his favourite tenet of Christian
assurance.&nbsp; On parting he singled me out for the privilege
of a double French kiss, and on my expressing a hope that we
should meet in the Father&rsquo;s House, he rebuked me for using
the word <i>hope</i>.&nbsp; With him it was a matter of
assurance.&nbsp; Then I reminded him of the difference between
present and future, and quoted St. Paul: &ldquo;For we are saved
<i>by hope</i>: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man
seeth, why doth he yet hope for?&nbsp; But if we hope for that we
see not, then do we with patience wait for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I parted from relatives, who had been my fellow-travellers,
and made my way next morning alone by boat to Vevay, thence
travelling to Basle and Strasburg.&nbsp; Traffic was interrupted,
and relics of revolution were seen in marching troops and
handcuffed prisoners.</p>
<p>In 1849 a movement occurred for meeting religious needs in
Kensington.&nbsp; A chapel was much needed on Notting Hill, and
one of my deacons, who lived there, promised a large donation for
the purpose.&nbsp; A few friends met in Hornton Street vestry,
and <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>opened
a subscription list, which at once secured &pound;1500.&nbsp;
With that we went to work.</p>
<p>At first, there was some notion of incorporating members of
the two congregations in one Church, with a copastorate; and Dr.
Vaughan, I think, indicated willingness to become my
colleague.&nbsp; I should not have objected to such union, but
feared lest the moral effect of our movement should be thereby
impaired.&nbsp; The scheme might have been looked upon as one of
self-aggrandisement, while it was meant as an act of
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; The latter it proved to be, for we drafted
off about fifty members, as the nucleus of a new Church.&nbsp;
Also we missed about two hundred seat-holders, who took pews in
the new edifice, and, of course, there arose a certain
<i>&eacute;clat</i> around Notting Hill which left Hornton Street
a little in the shade.&nbsp; But soon things revived; our chapel
became as full as ever.&nbsp; Funds recovered, liberal things
were devised, and one morning I found a handsome cheque on my
library table.&nbsp; Everybody seemed to be growing in kindness,
and Hornton Street rose to more than its previous
prosperity.&nbsp; It was an illustration of the
principle&mdash;true of communities as well as of
individuals&mdash;&ldquo;There is that scattereth and yet
increaseth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>In
connection with my early residence at Kensington I may mention a
circumstance which interested me.&nbsp; I observed several times,
sitting near my pulpit, an old gentleman.&nbsp; Upon inquiry, I
found it was the Rev. Michael Maurice, father to the Rev. F. D.
Maurice, then at the height of his influence as author and
preacher.&nbsp; I never had the pleasure of conversing with my
venerable hearer, but I learned from different sources much
relative to his character and career.&nbsp; Though descended from
a thoroughly orthodox family, he was educated for the ministry
under Dr. Abraham Rees, Dr. Kippis and Dr. Savage&mdash;the first
two being Arian divines, and the last a moderate Calvinist.&nbsp;
He became afternoon preacher at Dr. Priestley&rsquo;s Meeting
House; and after officiating in other Unitarian places of
worship, retired from pulpit work altogether.&nbsp; But he
habitually associated with orthodox Nonconformists during the
time he lived at Southampton.&nbsp; He also joined the British
and Foreign Bible Society, and spoke for it on the
platform.&nbsp; I wondered he should worship in Hornton Street,
but information subsequently obtained served to explain the
circumstance.&nbsp; He appears to have been a devout man with a
large measure of Evangelical feeling.&nbsp; <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>I mention him
as a type of no inconsiderable class of sincerely religious
people.</p>
<p>I knew but little of his distinguished son, only having met
him a few times at Dean Stanley&rsquo;s, and at Baldwin
Brown&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I used sometimes, on a Sunday afternoon, to
hear Mr. Maurice preach at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and was much
struck with the earnestness with which he repeated the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&nbsp; The difficulty he felt in making
himself understood is amusing.&nbsp; Some of the principles, he
said, which his friends attacked, were those he strongly objected
to himself, and those which they held as against him, were just
those on which he rested his own faith and hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
could not make them the least understand what I meant,&rdquo; he
went on to say; &ldquo;and if I did they would only dislike me
for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not obscurity of style, as many
thought, which made him unintelligible; but obscurity or
confusion of thought arising from complexity of perception.&nbsp;
He saw so much that it puzzled him how to express it.&nbsp; I
respected him greatly as an honest thinker, more anxious to
commend himself to the Searcher of hearts than to his
fellow-men.</p>
<p>It must have been, I think, in 1846 or 1847 that I received an
invitation to preach the annual sermon <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>on behalf of Newport Pagnell College,
and thither I went in the month of June.&nbsp; The Rev. Thos.
Palmer Bull, president, and his son, the Rev. Josiah Bull, were
living under the same roof, their house and garden full of
comfort and convenience, beauty and fragrance.&nbsp; The old
gentleman had a good library, and in nooks and corners were MSS.
and relics of Cowper and Newton, friends of his father, the Rev.
William Bull.&nbsp; The father was the &ldquo;Taurus,&rdquo; and
his son the &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; immortalised in Newton and
Cowper&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; When I had fulfilled my public duty
I intensely enjoyed conversation with my elder host, as he showed
me letters written, and relics possessed by the two celebrities
so closely connected with his father&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; He told
me how he used, when a boy, to accompany his father to Olney,
where he dined with the poet; that when grace was said, Cowper
would play with his knife and fork, to indicate he had no share
in acts of worship; that he would cheerfully converse on a
variety of topics, but shunned all reference to religion.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding, he would sometimes join in an Olney hymn; and
then check himself as one who had neither part nor lot in the
matter.&nbsp; He would kindly talk with little Tom, who
accompanied his <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>father on those visits, and they, on their way to and
from the now world-known town, would join in singing a psalm or
hymn, to a familiar tune.&nbsp; The old gentleman, I was
informed, sometimes indulged in the use of a pipe, as he drove
along the accustomed road.&nbsp; Full of such memories, I made an
excursion to Olney, stopped at the house near the park of the
Throgmortons, saw the room in which the poet slept, traced his
writing on a pane of glass, and thought of the despair to which,
in that chamber, he was so pitiable a victim.&nbsp; Then I was
taken to the unpretentious abode in the main street of Olney,
where he cultivated a close intimacy with John Newton, and kept
rabbits in his little garden,&mdash;which garden, at the time I
think of, remained much in its former state.&nbsp; The
summer-house, described by the bard, was still in
existence.&nbsp; Here, pausing for a moment to gather up another
memento of Cowper, I may mention, that a relative of mine pointed
out a house in East Dereham, which was Cowper&rsquo;s residence;
and told me that he remembered when a boy peeping through the
keyhole of a door, and seeing him sitting in his chair.&nbsp;
Cowper died at the residence of his kinsman, the Rev. Mr.
Johnson.&nbsp; A friend of his gave me a leaf, in the
poet&rsquo;s handwriting, from the translation of Homer.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Soon
after my return from this excursion I was chosen to fill up a
vacancy in the important Nonconformist Trust of William Coward, a
London merchant, who appointed Dr. Watts, Dr. Guyse, and Mr.
Neal, author of the &ldquo;History of the
Puritans,&rdquo;&mdash;with another person who was a
layman,&mdash;administrators of property which he bequeathed for
charitable purposes.&nbsp; Much of it consisted of Bank stock;
that having risen, the revenue had become very considerable.</p>
<p>Dr. Doddridge was a special friend of Mr. Coward&rsquo;s, and
had under his care several ministerial candidates, supported by
that gentleman.&nbsp; According to tradition, the merchant was
very punctual, the minister less so; and when the former invited
the latter to dinner, if he did not come exactly at the hour, the
footman was ordered not to admit him.&nbsp; A gentleman who lived
opposite was aware of this peculiarity, and his footman arranged
with Mr. Coward&rsquo;s footman, that when Dr. Doddridge had been
invited to dinner, mention should be made of it to the servant on
the other side the road, that a dinner might be prepared for his
reverence there.&nbsp; Other curious stories were told of our
founder, which I have forgotten.&nbsp; The perpetuation of Dr.
Doddridge&rsquo;s academy in different places, <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>and under
different forms, led to a transfer of the institution from
Wymondley in Hertfordshire to Torrington Square, London, where,
in association with London University College, it existed at the
time of my accession to the trusteeship.&nbsp; For about two
years I assisted in conducting the business of Coward College, as
a separate institution.&nbsp; Then came a change.&nbsp; There
were at the time three independent academies, as they were then
called, in London and the neighbourhood&mdash;Homerton, Highbury
and Coward.&nbsp; There were three sets of tutors, three boards
of administration, three distinct buildings, and three distinct
sources of expense.&nbsp; Previous attempts to accomplish the
union of these institutions had failed; but at the time to which
I now refer, an opportunity arrived for accomplishing the
union.&nbsp; After conferences between &ldquo;Heads of
Houses&rdquo; for some months, it was determined to sell the
three buildings, then occupied by the students, and to erect one
large new edifice, where they might be instructed together.&nbsp;
The erection of New College St. John&rsquo;s Wood, was the
result.&nbsp; In the negotiations connected with this change,
Dr., afterwards Sir William, Smith zealously co-operated with the
Coward trustees.&nbsp; My dear old friend, the Rev. William
Walford, took a great interest in the <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>accomplishment of this business, but
he died before it was completely effected.</p>
<p>He spent his last days in writing an autobiography, and after
his death I found it was written in letters addressed to myself,
with a request that I would edit the publication.&nbsp; This I
did with a melancholy satisfaction.&nbsp; He had suffered acutely
from mental depression, and the malady returned with violence
shortly before his death.&nbsp; My last visits were most
painful.&nbsp; He refused all consolation, and passed away under
a cloud, like that which attended the sunset of Cowper.&nbsp;
There were gleams of light, followed by dense darkness.&nbsp;
Then he sank into silence, if not torpor.&nbsp; Days and nights
rolled on, so different from their &ldquo;tranquil gliding&rdquo;
which he described in his letters; but it was the happy
confidence of his friends, notwithstanding his own fears, that
the angry billow, no less than the gentle wave, was bearing the
weather-beaten barque to the celestial shore.&nbsp; He died on
June 22nd, 1850.&nbsp; The poor body looked like a wreck, but
faith could see at rest the soul which had such hard work to
pilot the vessel beyond reach of storms.&nbsp; A post-mortem
examination proved that his depression arose from the condition
of the brain.&nbsp; He was a good Greek scholar, and delighted in
reading Plato.</p>

101</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
1850&ndash;1854</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1850 opened with a storm
of religious excitement, owing to a division of England by Papal
authority into Roman dioceses, at the suggestion of Dr.
Wiseman.&nbsp; It came to be called &ldquo;The Papal
Aggression.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some thought more was made of it, at the
time, than circumstances warranted; but, looked at through the
medium of history, it seemed to aim at a territorial authority
over England, inconsistent with our repudiation of Papal
supremacy.&nbsp; The way in which it was taken up by some good
people was not wise, and there was an anti-popish commotion
amongst some of my friends&mdash;a few only.&nbsp; The commotion
was unreasonable, but was overruled for good, as the incident led
some Protestants to look into their professed principles, which
doubtless, in our country, lie at the basis of civil and
religious liberty.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>From
one end of the island to the other, Nonconformists as well as
Churchmen took an opportunity for expressing attachment to the
Reformation.&nbsp; In two ways I became connected with what went
on.&nbsp; The Presbyterian, Congregational, and Baptist ministers
of London, representing the three denominations, resolved, in
common with other ecclesiastical bodies, to approach Her Majesty
with a protest against &ldquo;Papal Aggression.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
three denominations&mdash;like Convocation and certain English
corporations&mdash;have a right of presenting addresses to the
Sovereign; and on this occasion, the audience for accepting the
addresses, was appointed to be at Windsor Castle.&nbsp; When the
ceremony in the Royal Closet for receiving representatives of the
three denominations was over, we were invited to lunch in the
equerry&rsquo;s apartment.&nbsp; Covers were laid for two or
three gentlemen, in addition to our party.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, can
you tell me their names?&rdquo; I whispered to one of the
servants, who, from my previous residence in the town, happened
to know me.&nbsp; He could not say, and at the same moment the
strangers, who proved to be Roman Catholic noblemen, felt a like
curiosity to know who we were.&nbsp; I proceeded to explain the
origin of the three denominations, which was quite a revelation
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>to the
gentlemen; who informed us that they had just presented a loyal
address from 250,000 Catholics.&nbsp; They proceeded to say, that
English Protestants had quite misapprehended the meaning of
recent arrangements; and, after receiving a courteous
explanation, we sat down with them, and had a pleasant chat.</p>
<p>At that time I delivered at Kensington a short series of
discourses on the Roman Catholic controversy.&nbsp; I went over
some of the main points in that controversy, avoiding
misrepresentation and uncharitableness.&nbsp; I was not violent
enough to please some ultra-Protestants, but I had the
gratification of hearing, that two young Catholics ultimately
became Protestants, and were helped by the lectures.&nbsp; I have
met in the course of my life with several members of the Romish
Church, who have appeared to me estimable characters.&nbsp; I had
in my congregation a young lady, one of a family which ranked a
Cardinal amongst its members, and whose mother remained a
Catholic; in her dying illness she clung to Christ as her
Saviour, saying, in the words of Solomon&rsquo;s Song: &ldquo;I
held Him, and would not let Him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same year, as I have said, the Palace of Glass was
opened; and, being a Kensington resident, <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>I had
opportunities of watching the edifice rising out of the earth as
a beautiful exhalation.&nbsp; On moonlight nights, in the
previous winter, how often, on my way home, it revealed itself,
amidst floating mists, as a kind of ethereal structure!</p>
<p>There was a moral atmosphere created by the enterprise, which
those who do not recollect it are unable to appreciate.&nbsp; It
inspired thousands of people with expressions of charity and
goodwill.&nbsp; The opening day can never be forgotten by those
who witnessed it.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> newspaper had a leader,
which made one feel that a new era in history had arrived; that
war and strife were approaching an end, and a millennial age of
goodwill had dawned upon mankind.&nbsp; When, that day, we saw
crowds, not jostling and pushing against each other; for almost
every unit of the mass seemed willing to make way for a
neighbour; when we witnessed the opening service, and beheld the
royal procession moving through the stupendous
aisles,&mdash;representatives of &ldquo;all people that on earth
do dwell,&rdquo;&mdash;those present seemed to feel as they never
did before.&nbsp; As the poet Montgomery conversed with me on the
subject, he remarked that, looking down from the galleries upon
the throng which passed before his eyes, it &ldquo;reminded him
of flowing waters gently <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>gurgling through some broad
channel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people, thronging here and there round
corners, seemed like eddies in a river with lofty banks.</p>
<p>In the Exhibition year efforts were made for the religious
improvement of the people.&nbsp; The Press was in different ways
employed for this purpose; and amongst other methods there
appeared, as distinctively characteristic, a series of
evangelical discourses in Exeter Hall.&nbsp; They attracted
crowded audiences.&nbsp; The sermons were carefully reported and
widely circulated.&nbsp; About the same time several similar
methods were employed for the promotion of religion; services
were held in theatres and other places of amusement.&nbsp; Having
been engaged in these efforts, I can testify to the crowds
gathered together, and the general decorum of their
behaviour.&nbsp; Some to whom these buildings belonged took an
interest in the proceedings, as I knew from conversation with
dramatic managers, who expressed interest in the addresses
delivered.&nbsp; Afterwards, services were planned to be
conducted by Episcopal clergymen in Exeter Hall, but the plan was
frustrated by opposition of parochial authority.&nbsp; After
this, Dissenters undertook to supply the lack of service, and the
first Sunday night, an Independent minister officiated, reading
parts of the Liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer, and an <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>English
nobleman acted as clerk, leading the responses.</p>
<p>The same year (1851) it fell to my lot at the autumnal meeting
of the Congregational Union to read a memorial paper on Dr.
Doddridge, who had died just a hundred years before, and had been
pastor and Divinity Professor in Northampton, where the assembly
met.&nbsp; We occupied the old meeting-house in which he
preached; there in the vestry stood the chair in which he
sat.&nbsp; From the pulpit which had been his, the centenary
tribute to his memory was delivered.&nbsp; Mr. Bull, of Newport
Pagnell, presented the original MS. of a funeral sermon which the
doctor preached for his little daughter, partly written upon her
coffin.&nbsp; A common sympathy, amidst deathlike silence,
pervaded the audience, as if the divine who was commemorated had
only just left the world, and we had assembled to honour his
remains.&nbsp; The <i>genius loci</i> of the place, and
traditions of the good man, passed away so long before,
contributed to the occasion more impressiveness than it derived
from other circumstances.</p>
<p>In 1852 my beloved wife travelled with me to Elberfeld to see
our eldest daughter.&nbsp; We had, from an early period, formed
the plan of sending our children abroad for part of their
education, in order <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>that they might learn a foreign
language and see other forms of society besides our own.&nbsp;
Therefore we placed our firstborn under the care of Pastor and
Madame Schr&ouml;der,&mdash;two very excellent persons, whose
character and influence answered the high expectations we had
been led to form.&nbsp; Pastor Schr&ouml;der succeeded Dr.
Krummacher as one of the pastors of the Evangelical
communion.&nbsp; We enjoyed his society and that of his excellent
wife, and saw something of German habits, which interested me
much; they presented aspects unfamiliar to us.&nbsp; For
instance, one Sunday afternoon we took a walk in the woods with
our friend the pastor, and, on the way, he gathered into a large
company one after another of his people, until it formed quite a
procession; and, finally, we rested in a pleasant nook
encompassed by trees, where the people drank coffee, and sang
hymns.</p>
<p>After we had spent some days at Elberfeld we started for
Switzerland, where I planned my wife and daughter should spend
two or three weeks, whilst accompanied by a Kensington friend, I
proceeded on a journey to Italy.&nbsp; We started from Zurich,
crossed the lake, reached Coire and the Via Mala, and over the
Alps, came down to the Lake of Como; thence we reached Milan,
where we stayed three <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>days.&nbsp; I then became acquainted
for the first time with the Duomo and other churches.&nbsp; We
spent a Sunday in the city, and felt deeply interested in schools
founded by Cardinal Borromeo, carried on at the time with
exemplary care; and we found at eventide, in a church, groups of
worshippers, led by a layman, who knelt in front as they chanted
responses.&nbsp; I was struck then, and have been oftentimes
since, with the adaptation of Scripture passages on church walls,
pointing to salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; One
thought, too, of Ambrose, who forbade the approach of Theodosius,
wet with the blood he had shed at Thessalonica.&nbsp; Speaking of
the adaptation of Scripture in foreign churches, I may mention
other passages inscribed on their walls in other places, for
example, at Treves, where under a picture of &ldquo;The
Nativity&rdquo; we read &ldquo;Verily Thou art a God that hidest
Thyself,&rdquo; as applied to the Incarnation.&nbsp; Again, at
Nismes, if I recollect aright, under the fresco of a captive
rejoicing in his freedom, the words &ldquo;Thou hast loosed my
bonds&rdquo;; and under another, representing martyrs and virgins
at the portals of heaven, &ldquo;With joy and rejoicing shall
they be brought: they shall enter into the King&rsquo;s
palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; After all, the kernel of the Gospel
continues in Roman Catholic Christendom, though too often <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>concealed
under manifold innovations.&nbsp; Still there it is, if you look
for it.</p>
<p>My reference to Milan brings before me other recollections of
that wonderful city, as revisited again and again since
1852.&nbsp; Amidst manifold associations of art,
arch&aelig;ology, history, and religion, one image, indelibly
impressed on my mind, is that of Augustine under the fig tree in
a garden, listening to a voice which cried, &ldquo;Tolle
lege&rdquo;; at the hearing of which he sat down, took the
Testament in his hand, and read Rom. xiii., and thus became a new
creature in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Wandering in quiet old streets, I
have paused near some fig tree in a little enclosure of grass and
flowers, to think of him who became the grandest father of the
Latin Church.</p>
<p>From Milan we proceeded to Verona, and thence to Venice, where
I felt &ldquo;one of the greatest emotions of life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have seen it again and again, but the first charm was greatest
of all.&nbsp; Then Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter Martyr&rdquo;
adorned the walls of SS. Giovanni e Paulo.&nbsp; Wonderful
picture that! but it does not, to my mind, eclipse his S. Jerome
in the Brera at Milan.</p>
<p>Let me return to Kensington.&nbsp; Perhaps this is as good a
place as any, for saying a few words about people there, and
others with whom I was brought into contact, during my
pastorate.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Under
the ministry of my predecessor, Dr. Leifchild, there lived in one
of the stately houses in the neighbourhood, a
gentleman&mdash;commanding in person and polished in
manners&mdash;who was drawn towards the Dissenting pastor, though
he had no affection for Dissent; if he smiled at the system, he
liked some of the people.&nbsp; He lost largely on the Stock
Exchange, but he bore it with much magnanimity.&nbsp; I was
acquainted with some of the family, who were in prosperous
circumstances, and who became my kind friends.&nbsp; I once met
at their house with an old general&mdash;uncle to the Duchess of
Gordon&mdash;who related a singular anecdote.&nbsp; He had been
at the Eglinton Tournament, and, as the castle was crowded with
guests, he and another person shared the same bedroom.&nbsp; That
person was no other than the future Napoleon II.&nbsp; He kept
his companion awake with talk about the French Empire and his
uncle, declaring, that he was sure one day of sitting on his
uncle&rsquo;s throne.&nbsp; The ambitious dream filled his mind,
and overflowed in his abundant chat; though then it seemed a most
improbable imagination.&nbsp; The incident was related some time
after the tournament, and before the Republic was established;
and when I afterwards heard of Napoleon&rsquo;s election to the
presidentship, I <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>saw it was by no means unlikely that the daring
prophecy he had ventured, would come to pass.&nbsp; I have heard
from other people that he often, when residing in London, talked
in society of his coming elevation, as imperial ruler of the
French.&nbsp; The uncle had seen beforehand the dazzling star of
his destiny.&nbsp; His nephew did the same.&nbsp; There were
people who fancied something supernatural in this, but it may be
accounted for on natural principles.</p>
<p>Another story, of an amusing kind, I heard at a Chiswick
garden party, to which I was taken by the kind friends at whose
house I met the old Scotch soldier.&nbsp; Amongst personages of
rank present at Chiswick were certain bishops, who had not
dropped the old episcopal costume of a big wig, a most decidedly
broad-brimmed clerical hat, and a conspicuous apron.&nbsp; Right
Reverend brethren are still somewhat distinguished from other
people, though some of them reduce the distinction within very
restricted limits; forty or fifty years ago it was quite
otherwise.&nbsp; They appeared then commonly&mdash;to use an
undignified expression&mdash;in <i>full jig</i>, and as some
occupants of the Bench passed by, in unmistakable array of the
kind just noticed, a clergyman at the garden <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>party now
mentioned, told me of a prime minister, who used to remark, he
thought, &ldquo;Bishops well deserved all they got&rdquo; (and it
was much more then than it is now), &ldquo;for allowing
themselves to be dressed up, as such regular guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Literature and art were pretty well represented in Kensington,
at the period I speak of.&nbsp; Contributors to
<i>Punch</i>&mdash;Mark Lemon, Gilbert a Becket, and
others&mdash;were my neighbours, and with one of them I spent a
pleasant evening.&nbsp; Gilbert a Becket during a few weeks, when
the parish church underwent repairs, used pretty regularly to
attend our chapel, and I was struck by his attentiveness and
devotion.&nbsp; He expressed his readiness to spend a few hours
with me, at a friend&rsquo;s residence, only he stipulated that
it should not be on an opera night; and when it was proposed to
me I stipulated that it should not be on one of my service
nights.&nbsp; Preliminaries being settled we accordingly met, and
got on exceedingly well.&nbsp; What amuses me, as I think of it,
is that, though I am not at all given to pun-making, the presence
of a brilliant punster so inspired me, that I perpetrated one or
two hits, which Becket pronounced very fair.&nbsp; Perhaps I may
be forgiven by those who achieve pleasant things in that way, if
I <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>remark
that there is something contagious in the practice; and it is
difficult not to catch it, when in company with those who are
imbued with the habit.</p>
<p>With another celebrity I came in contact through intimacy with
his family, and his early connection with our place of
worship.&nbsp; I allude to Justice Talfourd.&nbsp; When a young
man he used to attend on Dr. Leifchild&rsquo;s ministry, his
father and mother being members of the Congregational Church at
Kensington.&nbsp; His mother, whom I knew well, related anecdotes
of his early days at home, and at Mill Hill School, where he had
schoolfellows who afterwards distinguished themselves in the
walks of Dissent.&nbsp; He wrote home about his companions and
told his mother of prayer-meetings amongst the boys; and of one
boy in particular, very imaginative, and florid on such
occasions.&nbsp; This schoolfellow became afterwards an eloquent
minister, well known as Dr. Hamilton of Leeds.&nbsp; The Judge
told me of his early attachment to that gentleman, and how,
during the doctor&rsquo;s last visit to London, he went to hear
him preach, and stepped into the vestry afterwards, to talk of
old times; but the preacher had left, which was a great
disappointment.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>There
was a strong religious side to Judge Talfourd&rsquo;s character,
and he used to speak with much enthusiasm of my predecessor, Dr.
Leifchild, whose preaching he said came up to his idea of the
Apostle Paul&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>Amongst artists living in Kensington were two Academicians,
Uwins and Philip, who both belonged to our congregation&mdash;the
first a regular, the second an occasional, attendant.&nbsp;
Philip&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a beautiful woman, whom he introduced
into some of his pictures&mdash;was a communicant with us at the
Lord&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; I often visited the artist&rsquo;s
studio, and listened to his picturesque description of Spain, and
also to his accounts of family afflictions which elicited my
sympathy.</p>
<p>From my boyhood I had taken an interest in art, and the
friendship of several men distinguished in its cultivation was
exceedingly instructive and pleasant.&nbsp; My travels on the
Continent, which enabled me to visit most of the principal
picture galleries,&mdash;rich in specimens by great
masters,&mdash;educated and purified what little taste I had; and
prompted me to somewhat extensive studies in artistic
literature.&nbsp; These, blended with other habits of reading, I
find an immense enjoyment in the leisure of my old age.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Mr.
Theed, the sculptor, and his family, who attended Kensington
Chapel, were our intimate friends; and he told me much about
Gibson, his companion in art, and intimate acquaintance for many
years, when they resided at Rome.&nbsp; With the latter gentleman
I became acquainted slightly when I was in Italy, and had a long
talk with him once about tinting sculpture,&mdash;which he
advocated with zeal, and practised with skill.&nbsp; I felt there
was force in what he said.&nbsp; Another Kensington
name,&mdash;that of Edward Corbould, the
water-colourist,&mdash;may be coupled with my friend
Theed&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Each was connected with the other in
artistic service to Her Majesty and family.&nbsp; I remember on
the Sunday morning after the Prince Consort&rsquo;s lamented
death, missing both these gentlemen at Divine worship, in
consequence of their being summoned to Windsor&mdash;one to take
a cast, and the other to make a drawing of the good
Prince&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>There was another group of hearers during the latter part of
my Kensington ministry, to whom I was much attached.&nbsp; One of
them, Cozens Hardy, M.P., who has won eminence in the legal
profession, is son to the oldest friend I have.&nbsp; All now
referred to are distinguished, not only by professional position,
but by continued study in classical learning.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>I
must not pass by &ldquo;annals of the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I
first went to Kensington, I was requested to visit an old
shoemaker, crippled, and in humble circumstances, but with a good
deal of natural politeness, the more striking from its
surroundings.&nbsp; He had been a wild young fellow, daring to
the last degree, and this was the cause of his incurable
lameness.&nbsp; He was converted under the ministry of Dr.
Leifchild.&nbsp; The preacher, in the course of a sermon, related
an anecdote of Mr. Cecil, who previous to his becoming decidedly
religious narrowly escaped with life, when thrown by his horse
across the track of a waggon, which in passing only crushed his
hat.&nbsp; The incident struck the listener.&nbsp; It resembled
his own experience, and riveted his attention, preparing him to
listen to the preacher&rsquo;s appeals.&nbsp; He became an
exemplary Christian; and I often sat by his bedside to hear him
describe the wondrous change wrought in his character, by Divine
grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a wonder unto many,&rdquo; he used to
say; and then, with faltering voice, would sing the old
hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That saved a wretch like me!<br />
I once was lost, but now am found;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was blind, but now I see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was not the only case in which the humbler <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>members of
the Church were a comfort to me.&nbsp; Often my heart was cheered
by communications made by them, touching spiritual life.&nbsp;
Such communications were perfectly artless, and arose from the
absence of that reserve which, in the upper class, is the result
of educational refinement.&nbsp; This circumstance often prevents
a free revelation of what cultured people think and feel on the
subject of religion.&nbsp; I have frequently noticed it, and
never inferred, from delicacy touching soul secrets, any want of
that which rises to the surface, and overflows in ready words,
when uneducated people speak of their Christian experience.</p>
<p>I cannot omit a reference to the Gurney family, with some of
whom I came into pleasant connection during my Kensington
residence.&nbsp; As a boy, I had some knowledge of their
ancestral relatives; and now I came into close friendship with
Mr. Bell, brother to Mrs. John Gurney, who was mother to Samuel
Gurney, the renowned London Quaker, and also to Joseph John
Gurney, of Earlham, near Norwich&mdash;an equally renowned
banker, and also a <i>Public Friend</i>, as preachers of that
denomination then were wont to be called.&nbsp; Mr. Bell had
become one of my hearers and a communicant, much to his spiritual
benefit, as he <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>and his family informed me.&nbsp; He was a chatty old
gentleman, and used to talk of his sister, Priscilla Wakefield,
of Miss Schemmelpenninck, and of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge&mdash;whom he met at the house of his friend Gilman,
resident in Highgate.&nbsp; Through frequent vivid references to
these celebrities, whom I knew by their writings and by report, I
came to have a sort of personal acquaintance with them.&nbsp;
Thus they became, more than ever, living realities.&nbsp; Besides
this, I came to have a slight personal knowledge of Mr. Samuel
Gurney, just mentioned, the well-known bill-broker, and also of
Mrs. Fry, his sister, who did so much good as a prison
visitor.&nbsp; Mr. Gurney was a stately person, with a benign
countenance, and a musical voice rich in persuasive tones.&nbsp;
The mental anxiety he felt during money panics, not only on his
own account, but also from sympathy with others, was such, that
he was known to spend sleepless nights pacing his chamber.&nbsp;
Mrs. Fry was as dignified as her brother, and I now in
imagination see her in her becoming Quaker garb, as she talked to
me about her nephew Bell, and spoke gratefully of the benefit he
had derived from my ministry.&nbsp; The younger Mr. Samuel Gurney
came to live at Prince&rsquo;s Gate, Kensington, and used to
worship with <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>us occasionally.&nbsp; At his table I met with the
Bunsens, and other remarkable friends and relatives of his.&nbsp;
He told me that at any time when I needed, in Christian work,
pecuniary help, I might apply to him without hesitation.&nbsp;
The crash on &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; was a terrible trial, as
it made him, after being one of the richest of London citizens,
dependent on his relatives.&nbsp; I wrote to him words of
condolence, to which he beautifully replied, saying that he
trusted the tribulation which had befallen him would be for his
spiritual welfare.&nbsp; His excellent wife bore up nobly, and
the two afforded admirable instances of Christian patience and
resignation.</p>
<h2><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
1854&ndash;1862</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> April 4th, 1854, I started the
first time for Rome, provided with letters of introduction to
Gibson, the sculptor, Penry Williams, the landscape painter, and
two Roman Catholic dignitaries, one a Monseignor, the other
president of the English College.&nbsp; All these gentlemen were
polite and helpful to me.</p>
<p>My companions were Dr. Raffles, Dr. Halley, the Rev. Spencer
Edwards, and another friend.&nbsp; The first of them was
wonderful for relating stories, which he always told <i>secundum
artem</i>.&nbsp; He kept us awake one whole night with his
amusing anecdotes; but, as we were travelling through France at a
time when espionage was prevalent, he would not allow us to make
any political allusions.&nbsp; I was surprised at the
retentiveness of his verbal memory; whilst he repeated long
pieces, in which <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>the amusement consisted of odd words, connected with no
rational meaning, when put together.</p>
<p>It was Holy Week when we reached Rome.&nbsp; On Thursday there
was the feet-washing at St. Peter&rsquo;s, and the supper
afterwards: the Pope, as &ldquo;servant of servants,&rdquo;
ministering to the poor, but with great pomp on both
occasions.&nbsp; We arranged to see the former, and found a
transept on the right hand, fitted up for the occasion.&nbsp;
Rank, fashion, beauty, arrayed in mourning, found accommodation
in galleries commanding a good view.&nbsp; Ladies were veiled,
gentlemen wore evening dress.&nbsp; Admission to that part of the
edifice could be obtained on no other conditions.&nbsp; Pio Nono,
a pleasant, genial-looking old man, who won a good opinion as
soon as you looked at him, did his part well.&nbsp; He read the
Gospel (John xiii.) in tones wonderfully musical and distinct,
and then washed the pilgrims&rsquo; feet with grace and
reverence.&nbsp; The whole was artistically and solemnly
done.&nbsp; &ldquo;One can laugh at these things, as described in
books,&rdquo; said Dr. Raffles&mdash;a staunch
Nonconformist&mdash;&ldquo;but <i>not</i> when witnessed, as now,
in this magnificent place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still, on a calm review,
nothing like <i>worship</i> appears in any part of the
ceremony.&nbsp; Then the <i>Miserere</i> in the afternoon!&nbsp;
Those who did not witness it years ago <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>can have no
idea of it now; or of the gorgeous procession, amidst a blaze of
light, to the altar of S. Paulo, and the prostration of the
Pontiff and his Cardinals on the floor, in the midst of darkness,
candles having been extinguished, one by one.&nbsp; The scene on
the grand staircase was striking as the dignitaries returned,
varying in appearance and character&mdash;an ascetic monk, a man
of the world, another looking studious and reflective, a fourth
keen and statesmanlike.&nbsp; Nobody could deny the Italian
scenic skill in such matters.&nbsp; I have been at Rome in
Easter, since then, much struck with subsequent changes.&nbsp;
When all was over on my first Easter in Rome, I went to the
English Episcopal Church, where the Lord&rsquo;s Supper was
administered according to Protestant rites, and I could not but
be impressed by the contrast between the two services.&nbsp; It
illustrated the change effected by the Reformation.&nbsp; I
mentioned this once to the Rev. Frederic Denison Maurice, who, of
course, agreed with me; and, talking of Rome, he happened to
relate an anecdote which I do not remember having seen in
print.&nbsp; Pio Nono, after the suppression of Latin nunneries
in Poland, received a visit from the Emperor of Russia.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are a great king,&rdquo; said the former to the
latter, &ldquo;one of the <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>mightiest in the world.&nbsp; I am a
poor feeble man, servant of servants; but I cite you to meet me
before the Judge of all, and to answer for your treatment of
helpless women.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the old assumption of
authority; but there was a touch of grandeur in the words.</p>
<p>I saw the catacombs, following my guide, taper in hand; and in
one of the strange passages was accosted by name.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who could have expected to be recognised in this dark
underworld?&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; It turned out to be a
person who had lived at Eton, and been a hearer of mine at
Windsor.&nbsp; Other recognitions have occurred to me of an odd
kind, when visiting several places.</p>
<p>I became so attracted by what I saw in Rome, and drank so
deeply into the spirit of Arnold&rsquo;s letters, written there,
that my last day was spent in pensive leave-takings of ruin after
ruin, church after church.&nbsp; I have been there twice since,
each for a longer time than the first; but not with quite the
impression which I felt in the first instance.</p>
<p>We proceeded to Naples, stopped at Cisterna, at Terracinia, at
Gaeta, and at S. Agata.&nbsp; Whoever has travelled the same road
must long remember the fragrance of the orange-groves and the
coloured dresses of the peasantry.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>We
had no trouble at custom-houses on the way, for my two companions
and myself travelled in humble fashion.&nbsp; Otherwise did the
two doctors, already mentioned, fare.&nbsp; Large sums were
demanded of them on the Neapolitan frontier; and when they
refused to pay, their luggage was searched, and a coloured
pen-wiper being found, the officials declared it was a
<i>revolutionary cockade</i>, and that books in their
portmanteaus were no doubt full of treason and heresy.&nbsp;
There was no alternative but to stay where they were, or to allow
a soldier to accompany them in charge of the suspected
articles.&nbsp; All this trouble was followed by apologies on
reaching Naples, after an appeal had been made to the English
Consul.</p>
<p>We saw the picture galleries and museums in Naples, and
explored the city as well as we could during our short
stay.&nbsp; Religious services of a special kind were being held
in one of the churches; and I remember entering it on an evening
when it was crowded with people, listening to a friar, who was
earnestly preaching.&nbsp; Next morning, on revisiting the place,
it was crowded as the night before, and the same priest occupied
the pulpit.&nbsp; We drove along the old coast road, by the
so-called Tomb of Virgil to Castellamare, Sorrento, <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Posilipo
and Pozzuoli (the Puteoli of the Acts), and had dreams of the
luxurious life once spent on these shores, and of Paul&rsquo;s
disembarkation on his way to Rome.&nbsp; We also spent a day at
Vesuvius, where clouds of vapour were rolling upward; and I, with
one of our party, crawled down to the crater, as near as we
could, much to the dismay of our senior companions.&nbsp; On our
way back to Naples we tarried as long as possible at Pompeii,
looking at the wonders of that memorable spot.</p>
<p>An important step was taken at Kensington on my return from
Italy.&nbsp; The &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; sent to Notting Hill did not
permanently reduce the numbers of our congregation.&nbsp; On the
contrary, they considerably advanced.&nbsp; The old chapel became
more than ever inconvenient, and we resolved to build a new and
much larger one.</p>
<p>I must now pass from local and personal affairs to notice a
movement in Congregationalism at large.&nbsp; Independency leads
to isolated action on the part of local Churches.&nbsp; It is
unfriendly to cohesion and co-operation.&nbsp; It provides for
freedom, and nothing else.&nbsp; Old Independents saw this, and
checked the evil by maintaining local fellowships between Church
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and
Church, by the employment of &ldquo;messengers&rdquo; one to
another. <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a></p>
<p>About 1830 the wiser heads amongst us had clearly seen the
evil, and endeavoured to overcome it.&nbsp; They concluded that
centrifugal tendencies should be met by a centripetal
force.&nbsp; Mr. Binney used to say, we were a collection of
limbs&mdash;legs, arms, feet, and hands&mdash;all in motion, but
not an organised body.&nbsp; To frame a body out of so many
members, was the design of the Congregational Union.&nbsp;
Algernon Wells may be regarded as its founder.&nbsp; He was one
of the most beautiful characters I have ever
known&mdash;intelligent, well read, sagacious, with extensive
knowledge of men and things, and a profound attachment to
evangelical truth.&nbsp; He had a rare order of eloquence, and
wove pleasant tissues of thought in his sermons and
speeches.&nbsp; If his speeches were not always sermons, his
sermons were almost always speeches.&nbsp; There was a great
charm in his conversation, and it often overflowed with
wit.&nbsp; Though a decided Congregationalist, he was full of
charity, and cultivated harmonious intercourse with other
denominations.&nbsp; His policy <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>as to the newly-formed organisation,
was to make the meetings fraternal rather than
controversial&mdash;a brotherly society to promote edification
rather than an ecclesiastical army to fight with soldiers
outside, or a council to settle disputes inside.&nbsp; The early
meetings were held in the Congregational Library, and did not
muster more than a hundred members.&nbsp; &ldquo;Business&rdquo;
received at times a look askance: spiritual edification excited
desire, and stimulated expression.&nbsp; Now and then came
touches of humour, as when after talking about the state of the
denomination till we were hungry, one brother rose and gravely
asked &ldquo;whether any intelligence had arrived from the
Sandwich Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good Algernon Wells died in 1851, and soon afterwards I was
requested by a sub-committee to meet them in conference on an
important matter.&nbsp; It was to propose my election as Mr.
Wells&rsquo; successor.&nbsp; Now, secretaryships have always
been my aversion&mdash;from an instinct, I suppose, such as
guides inferior animals to shun what they were never made
for.&nbsp; The secretaryship of the City Mission had been pressed
upon me soon after my arrival in London, but I steadily refused
it, from a conviction of utter incompetence; and, for the same
reason, I declined to entertain the proposal just
mentioned.&nbsp; He who <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>proposed the office for me accepted
it for himself, and we worked together pleasantly through several
years.&nbsp; I was elected chairman of the Union in May 1856,
amidst much excitement.&nbsp; There have been strains on its
strength more than once, but this first was the greatest.</p>
<p>Dr. Campbell had been for some time a prominent member.&nbsp;
Hard-headed and hard-handed, of a bold, open countenance, and
with a habit of planting his foot pretty firmly on the
ground,&mdash;the outer man well indicated the inner;
kind-hearted and affectionate at home, but not the same on a
platform, or with an editorial pen in hand.&nbsp; He then gave no
quarter to anybody who opposed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a good
fellow,&rdquo; it was once said to him by a loving spirit;
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like that great club you
carry.&rdquo;&nbsp; That great club he swung about, much to the
terror of many, and consequently he exercised a despotic sway, to
which they were indisposed to submit.&nbsp; He held the doctrines
of Calvinistic theology with a firm grasp, and looked with alarm
upon certain opinions springing up amongst his brethren.&nbsp; He
considered that there was looseness of sentiment, and a range of
thought too free, existing amongst younger men, which imperilled
the evangelical soundness of the Churches.&nbsp; He gave it the
name of <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span><i>Negative Theology</i>.&nbsp; The name took, and was
bandied about to the annoyance of persons to whom it was applied,
many of them holding positive truths as firmly as Dr. Campbell
himself.&nbsp; It happened that in 1856 Mr. Lynch, a man of
genius and sensibility, with a mind cast in a mould the opposite
of Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s, published a small volume of poetry
entitled &ldquo;The Rivulet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the hymns it
contained excited admiration, and are now extensively used; but
the book, as a whole, aroused Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s wrath beyond
measure.&nbsp; He wrote a criticism upon it, which awakened
indignation in those who had read &ldquo;The Rivulet&rdquo; with
approval.&nbsp; Fifteen brethren drew up and signed a protest
against this style of review.</p>
<p>There existed, no doubt, a tendency on the part of a few
brethren to give up certain theological expressions long held
sacred, and also to throw into the background, if not to
question, points of doctrine deemed perfectly
Congregational.&nbsp; In the opposite quarter there appeared a
tenacity of diction and an emphasis of opinion on old lines,
accompanied by ungenerous reflections respecting those whom they
deemed innovators.&nbsp; Very naturally, personal feeling was
thus stirred up, and the Union seemed threatened with
disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We men are a mysterious sort of creatures,&rdquo; said
<a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>John
Howe to Richard Baxter.&nbsp; No doubt we are, and that in more
ways than one: in this especially, that whilst discussing
theories of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;all fountains
of love&mdash;we are apt to be found drawing water from the wells
of Marah.</p>
<p>The controversy, now spoken of, related to old and new aspects
of theological thought.&nbsp; Looking back, I can but say, the
balance sheet of past and present, in respect to what is now
noticed, shows both gain and loss.&nbsp; All the gain, it strikes
me, might have been secured without incurring loss at all; and,
in making up the whole account, there should have been more
charity in judging individuals, and more justice in discussing
principles.</p>
<p>I wished, in my address, to combine the two, and so render the
whole a sort of Irenicon.</p>
<p>A personal correspondence followed between two good men, which
is now, I hope, buried in oblivion; but no secession of members
from the Union took place, that I know of.&nbsp; The two
tendencies still exist, but they call for no criticism in these
pages.&nbsp; My views on the subject I have often expressed.</p>
<p>Before the close of my Windsor ministry I had begun to indulge
in foreign travel, and in 1854, when I had spent some time in my
Kensington pastorate, I ventured on a trip to Rome, which I <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>have
described already.&nbsp; After that, visits abroad were numerous,
and from amongst them I select one paid in 1856, when I spent a
few weeks with my two sons, who were then being educated in
Berlin.&nbsp; My dear wife accompanied me through the greater
part of the tour, as she was anxious to see how the lads were
getting on.&nbsp; We made our way to the Prussian capital through
Hanover, and, on reaching our destination, found all well.&nbsp;
After spending a little while in Berlin, seeing the sights and
becoming acquainted with some excellent people, we made an
excursion to the South, and spent a few days at Dresden, where
antiquities, pictures, and drives in the neighbourhood greatly
delighted us.&nbsp; We proceeded to Schandau, a pretty little
village, and there took lodgings, initiating ourselves into
amusing details of German life.&nbsp; We attended the parish
church on Sunday, taking interest in the clergyman, who was
expounding to his people the history of David.&nbsp; We witnessed
some of life&rsquo;s joys and sorrows, especially a funeral,
which was very picturesque&mdash;bright flowers, red roses and
green leaves, relieving the darkness of death, the hope of Heaven
shedding light on the sorrow of bereavement.&nbsp; Excursions in
the neighbourhood added to our family enjoyments <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>of this
sojourn, and one day we came in contact with royalty.&nbsp; The
King of Saxony, the Queen, and a few of the Court, climbed up a
hill which we had selected as a resting-place, commanding views
of the Elbe.&nbsp; Their Majesties&rsquo; servants in livery
(who, by the way, were very civil to us) paid the royal reckoning
to a humble ch&acirc;let-keeper, as any of his subjects might
do.&nbsp; We watched the King and attendants as they embarked in
a boat for their Dresden home.&nbsp; My boys and I pushed on to
Prague, where the bridge and St. John Nepomuk, the Hradschin, and
the thirty years&rsquo; war, John Huss and his house in the
Bethlehem platz, the Jews&rsquo; town on the banks of the Moldau,
the Jewish burial ground, and the old synagogue, inspired
historical memories of deep interest.&nbsp; We joined mamma and
returned to Dresden the way we came; and there, after long
gazings on the picture gallery, especially at Raphael&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Madonna and Child&rdquo;&mdash;opposite to which people
sat reverently, as if engaged in devotion&mdash;father and mother
parted from the dear boys, and we wended our way homewards; not
without lingering in Lutherland to look at homes and haunts of
the great Reformer.</p>
<p>To return to my Kensington flock.&nbsp; In the year 1857, one
Sunday night, after I had retired to rest, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>I heard a
loud ringing at the door-bell, and immediately rose.&nbsp; On
opening the window, there stood a carriage; and the coachman, as
soon as by gaslight he saw my face, cried out, &ldquo;Oh, sir, my
mistress is dead!&rdquo;&nbsp; His mistress was Mrs. Jacomb,
residing with her husband and family at Notting Hill.&nbsp; They
had all been at Divine worship that morning in their usual
health.&nbsp; The carriage had been sent to take me back to the
mourners.&nbsp; I immediately rose and went.&nbsp; On reaching
the house I witnessed a scene of domestic distress such as I
never witnessed before.&nbsp; My deceased friend had in the
morning worshipped with us, in her usual delicate health, and, as
I learned, in more than her usual cheerfulness.&nbsp; She was
preparing for evening service, when she was suddenly seized with
illness, and in a short time expired.&nbsp; The husband and
family were in deep distress, but they had a blessed knowledge of
Him who brought life and immortality to light.&nbsp; She was a
woman rich in spiritual sympathy, and had been no ordinary friend
to me and mine, in our early married life.&nbsp; We had a large
family, and, though favoured above many, had our domestic
trials.&nbsp; How often I thought of what Paul said of
&ldquo;Ph&oelig;be, our sister&rdquo;: &ldquo;She has been a
succourer of many, and of myself <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>also.&rdquo;&nbsp; I never knew any
one who had more tender sympathy in trouble than Mrs. Jacomb, or
was more swift in expressing it.&nbsp; Her husband was worthy of
her, and her children &ldquo;rise up to call her
blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who survive are cherished
friends.&nbsp; He was of an old Puritan stock, descendant of Dr.
Jacomb, a renowned ejected clergyman after the Commonwealth; and
the family genealogy is rich in noted names and memories.</p>
<p>In this chapter I cannot refrain from recording my own
domestic sorrows.&nbsp; In 1853 a sweet child had
died&mdash;little Catherine, born shortly after we left Windsor;
and in 1858 another, more advanced in life, a boy named Arnold,
full of energy and promise, was taken from us by our Heavenly
Father.&nbsp; His illness was brief; but beforehand my dear wife
had been anxious for his spiritual welfare, and her conversations
were followed by the Divine blessing.&nbsp; His joyous, winning
ways had won the hearts of visitors, and his death widely
affected my congregation, awakening sympathy to a degree which
inspired my liveliest gratitude.&nbsp; Our friend Joshua Harrison
preached a funeral sermon for the dear boy, full of pathos and
power.</p>
<p>In 1859 a friend accompanied me to the Pyrenees.&nbsp;
Travelling by French railways, we reached Bayonne <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>at the end
of August, and then crossed the Spanish frontier in a Spanish
diligence, which had all the lumber and shabby trappings of
French ones.&nbsp; We reached San Sebastian at night, and next
morning took a walk on the promenade, where the ladies in
mantillas and veils flourished their fans with grace and dignity;
and if there be something gay in French solemnity, there is
something grave in the gaiety of Spaniards.&nbsp; We again
climbed up a diligence, and travelled through the Lower Pyrenees
to Pau, where, from the Grand Terrace, we saw peering out from
the haze of a hot summer sky the mountain range&mdash;not near,
as many imagine, but many miles off.&nbsp; Of course we saw the
old palace where Henri IV. was born and wrapped up in his shell
cradle.&nbsp; Along roads bordered by woods and hills, reminding
one of Wharfedale, we reached an elevation at Sevignac,
overlooking the valley of the Gave, with magnificent mountains in
front, Pic du Midi coming into full view.&nbsp; Eaux Bonnes, with
all the luxuries of a French watering-place, was then reached,
whence we proceeded to Eaux Chaudes, where the mountains become
awfully precipitous.&nbsp; We looked down from zigzag roads, cut
out of declivities buttressed by rocks and embankments, with
boiling torrents at the foot, roaring like thunder.&nbsp; <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>The Pic du
Midi, streaked with snow, rises up so as to remind one of an
Egyptian pyramid.</p>
<p>We determined to visit Pantacosa, and passed through a
romantic defile, crossed the Spanish frontier again, and halted
at a village, where the houses seemed walls without windows, the
outlook being altogether from the back.&nbsp; Glimpses of
Aragon&rsquo;s broad plain were caught, as we looked south, and
crowds of Spanish muleteers passed us, laden with
merchandise.&nbsp; The baths of Pantacosa occupy a gloomy region,
shut in by rocks, and there I spent the Sunday as an invalid, my
strength being overtaxed; but next day I rose in the enjoyment of
health and vigour.&nbsp; Then we made our way to Luz.&nbsp; The
church of the Templars built there is half fortress and half
sanctuary.&nbsp; You enter through a machicolated gateway, into a
church, the gloomiest I ever saw.&nbsp; Through a little door,
the <i>Cagots</i>, a proverbial race weak both in body and mind,
used to enter for worship.</p>
<p>Near to Luz is St. Sauveur, a narrow valley, richly wooded,
with a tiny village jammed in among the rocks.&nbsp; At the time
of our visit, the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Eugenie were
staying there.&nbsp; The house they occupied was small and plain;
nothing distinguished it but the two <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>sentinels at the door.&nbsp; All was
silent and solitary, and nobody seemed to notice the royal
residence, besides ourselves.&nbsp; In the afternoon, we saw
their Majesties returning from a drive in open carriages with
outriders.&nbsp; Napoleon sat on the box, Eugenie was chatting
with her lady attendants.&nbsp; On alighting she remained at the
door of the house, playing with her walking stick, and receiving
a letter-bag.&nbsp; The Emperor came out, lighted a cigar, smoked
and then walked on to inspect some men at work on a new road.</p>
<p>We made an excursion to Gavarnie&mdash;a shady defile with
precipitous rocks, overhanging woods, and a river foaming and
roaring four hundred feet below.&nbsp; Beyond is the Cirque, a
basin-shaped valley of semicircular rocks, with steps and stages,
whilst a drapery of water fringes them all round.&nbsp; We
ascended the Pic de Bergons, tarried a day at Bagn&egrave;res de
Bigorre, a central spot for tourists, with the usual
appurtenances of such places.&nbsp; We proceeded to
Bagn&egrave;res de Luchon, by a romantic drive, commanding a view
of the Maladetta with its snows and glaciers.</p>
<p>In the course of our rambles in the Pyrenees we were struck
with Eastern customs.&nbsp; An unmuzzled ox went round a heap of
corn.&nbsp; Sheep were not driven but led, and wine was kept in
leathern bottles.</p>
<h2><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
1862&ndash;1865</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1862, being the
Bicentenary of the Bartholomew ejectment, was largely given by
English Nonconformists to a remembrance of the confessorship and
heroism which marked the ejectment of ministers in 1662.&nbsp; A
meeting was held in the spring at St. James&rsquo;s Hall,
Piccadilly, when papers were read, bearing on the
commemoration.&nbsp; The preparation of one of them fell to my
lot; but I was taken ill at the time for its delivery, and it had
to be read by my friend, the Rev. Joshua Clarkson Harrison.&nbsp;
A story is told of Garrick&rsquo;s reading a poem of Hannah
More&rsquo;s, before a party of friends, when the effect produced
was by Garrick attributed to the lady&rsquo;s composition, and by
the lady to the reader&rsquo;s elocution.&nbsp; Whatever might be
the impression made at St. James&rsquo;s Hall on the reading of
the paper, it was divided between my <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>friend and me, after the same
fashion.&nbsp; In this address I advocated a Bartholomew
celebration, on the ground, that it was good to remember
sacrifices made for conscience&rsquo; sake, and therefore
professed my readiness to honour Jeremy Taylor as well as Richard
Baxter.&nbsp; This brought a letter from the Bishop of Down and
Connor testing my sincerity by an appeal on behalf of an Irish
cathedral restoration in memory of Jeremy Taylor.&nbsp; I sent a
small contribution, which brought back a pleasant response, such
as I highly valued.&nbsp; Afterwards I met him at the
Athen&aelig;um, when he invited me to visit him, with a view to
Christian union in Ireland.&nbsp; I should add that the
Bishop&rsquo;s scheme for the cathedral restoration failed, and
he politely returned my small contribution.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1862, I read a paper to the Congregational
Assembly, in which I advocated certain methods of
improvement.&nbsp; This subject I took up afterwards, with no
result, however, that I could discover.&nbsp; The faults of other
systems are always more welcome than the reformation of our
own.</p>
<p>In 1863 we were visited by a family bereavement which was one
of the heaviest sorrows of my life.&nbsp; John Howard Stoughton,
born at Windsor in 1842, <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>was a lad of extraordinary
character, witty and artistic beyond his brothers and sisters,
who loved him with no ordinary love.&nbsp; His love of art led us
to place the youth under Mr. Thomas, a distinguished sculptor and
decorator, largely employed in works at Windsor Castle.&nbsp; Our
boy devoted himself to his pursuits with an assiduity which
created much anxiety in his mother and in me, for it evidently
injured his health.&nbsp; In the spring of 1861 we took him to
Hastings, and Dr. Moore, an eminent physician there, carefully
studied his case, and, as the result, advised that his artistic
pursuits should be for awhile suspended, and that he should
travel abroad, where he would see and learn much, without tasking
his physical power.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the summer of 1861, he
visited the Continent with his elder brother and me, went up and
down the Rhine, and saw pictures, statues, and decorations, which
interested his mind without overtasking his bodily
strength.&nbsp; In the following autumn he was better, and under
medical advice we arranged that, in company with one of his
sisters, he should spend the winter in Rome.&nbsp; They did so
accordingly, and our hopes were raised; but in the spring he had
an attack, which rendered it advisable that he should remove from
Rome to some other part of Italy.&nbsp; He did <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>so, and
paid a visit to friends in Leghorn.&nbsp; I left home with
another of my daughters and two nieces, joining my children where
they were staying; thence I accompanied them, on a pleasant tour
through Florence, over the Apennines, and, by way of Bologna,
Milan, and the Alps, to Geneva.&nbsp; Thence we came home through
France.&nbsp; We returned in good spirits; but, as winter
approached, fears reawakened.&nbsp; Gradually the invalid became
weaker; but faith in the Invisible and Divine Father grew
stronger and stronger.&nbsp; The youth spent with us a cheerful
Christmas; but in spring it was obvious he was not long for this
world.&nbsp; As the end approached he talked calmly on the
subject with his beloved brother, the two being united in bonds
of Christian faith, as well as natural affection.&nbsp; I can
never forget the Holy Communion we&mdash;mother, father, brother,
and sisters&mdash;enjoyed in a room overlooking our garden, when
bursting buds told of nature&rsquo;s returning life, and the dear
sufferer bore unmistakable signs of approaching death.&nbsp; But
he was calm and cheerful, and took deep interest in the gracious
ordinance.&nbsp; It was administered with solemnity by our dear
friend Harrison, who loved Howard as though he had been his own
son.&nbsp; He expired on March 31st, 1863, and on the following
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Sunday
evening my brother just named preached a memorable funeral sermon
in Kensington Chapel.</p>
<p>In 1864 Dr. Stanley became Dean of Westminster, and on his
expressing a wish to be introduced to some Nonconformist
brethren, Dr. William Smith&mdash;editor of so many valuable
dictionaries, and with whom I was then associated in the business
of New College&mdash;kindly gave a dinner party to which he
invited me.&nbsp; The Dean afterwards finding there was between
us some similarity of taste in literature, and sympathy in
desires for union, invited me to the Deanery; and so began a
friendship with him and Lady Augusta, which lasted as long as
they lived, and proved one of the most precious privileges
vouchsafed to me, by the providence of our Heavenly Father.&nbsp;
On December 28th, 1865, &ldquo;the Feast of the Holy
Innocents&rdquo;&mdash;the Dean preached a sermon in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; The sermon was in commemoration of the Abbey&rsquo;s
foundation by Edward the Confessor eight hundred years
before.&nbsp; The text was felicitously chosen from John x. 22,
23,&mdash;&ldquo;It was the feast of the <i>Dedication</i>, and
it was <i>winter</i>, and Jesus walked in the temple in
<i>Solomon&rsquo;s porch</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Feast of the
Dedication&rdquo; corresponded with the character of the service;
&ldquo;winter&rdquo; was the season of both celebrations; the <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>northern
porch&mdash;a main entrance to the Abbey&mdash;is called
&ldquo;Solomon&rsquo;s porch.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sermon was not
less appropriate than the text.&nbsp; It sketched the history of
the venerable edifice, and contained marked allusions to
Nonconformist ministrations within its walls during the
Commonwealth.&nbsp; Being present on the occasion, I wrote to the
Dean afterwards in reference to his allusions, when, in reply, he
said, &ldquo;It gave me additional pleasure to deliver them, from
the reflection that there was at least one person present capable
of entering into them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the sermon, as delivered,
he spoke of the Westminster Confession as the only one ever
<i>imposed</i> in the <i>whole Island</i>, and on my calling his
attention to this statement, and pointing out the distinction
between the <i>doctrinal</i> and ecclesiastical part of the
Confession, he answered, &ldquo;I was not ignorant of the
distinction, nor did I mean to say it was <i>imposed</i> in any
offensive sense.&nbsp; For I was anxious not to say a word that
could be offensive to any of my brethren, and merely wished to
call attention to the fact, that a document, which had received
in part a wider legal recognition than any other since the
Reformation, came from Westminster Abbey.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
sermon, as <i>printed</i>, are the words &ldquo;<i>sanctioned by
law</i> for the whole Island,&rdquo; and in <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>a note,
&ldquo;The doctrinal Articles of the Westminster Confession of
Faith (were) sanctioned by the English Parliament in 1647, and
the whole Confession by the Scottish Parliament in
1648.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In further illustration of the Dean&rsquo;s ingenuity when
turning Scripture to account in the improvement of events, I may
here repeat what he once related to me.&nbsp; He happened on a
Saturday to be preparing a sermon for the Abbey, on some occasion
when he was to plead for <i>two</i> objects, and had chosen for
his text Gen. xxvii. 38&mdash;&ldquo;And Esau said unto his
father, hast thou but one blessing my father?&nbsp; Bless me,
even me also, O my father.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the Dean was writing
his discourse, some one stepped in and told him, the American
President, General Grant, intended to be at the Abbey the next
day, and suggested that it would be gratifying to Americans if
some allusion was made to the incident.&nbsp; Immediately it was
turned to account by the Dean in this way&mdash;that God had many
blessings which He distributed amongst his children; that bounty
to one did not mean denial to another; that Great Britain, for
instance, had been blessed, but God had rich benefactions for
America as well.</p>
<p>For years I felt an earnest desire to visit the East, and thus
to become personally acquainted with Bible <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>lands.&nbsp; A meeting was held in 1865 to present me
with a purse of &pound;400, and a pledge that expenses incurred
through my absence from Kensington should be met, without any
pecuniary responsibilities on my part.&nbsp; The friends who
accompanied me were Dr. Allon, of Union Chapel, Islington, Dr.
Spence, of the Poultry Chapel, London, Dr. Bright, minister of
the Independent Chapel, Dorking, and two young lay
friends&mdash;Stanley Kemp-Welch and Thomas Wilson.&nbsp; The
Dean of Westminster gave me introductions to people he knew in
Palestine, and afforded valuable assistance in other ways.</p>
<p>We started in February 1865.&nbsp; I kept a journal and sent
home long letters.&nbsp; We visited Alexandria and Cairo, and
then proceeded through the desert of Sinai to the monastery at
the foot of Jebel Mousa.&nbsp; Turning north, we made our way to
Gaza, thence to Ramleh, and so onwards to Jerusalem.&nbsp; The
members of our little party, as we approached the city on
horseback, rode at a considerable distance from each other.&nbsp;
I knew that we should cross some ridges, before we caught sight
of the city, and I happened to be in the rear of my
fellow-travellers.&nbsp; I watched the foremost of them till I
saw him pull up his horse, pause awhile, then take off his
hat.&nbsp; I knew what that meant, and the <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>feelings
awakened I can never forget while I live.&nbsp; I eagerly, and I
may say reverently, followed the foremost horseman, and as soon
as I caught sight of the walls and the gate, I am not ashamed to
say, my eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>As we entered the Holy City the bustle was very great.&nbsp;
Bedouins with yellow scarves round their heads, and striped robes
on their shoulders; Syrians with snowy turbans, short jackets,
and flowing trousers; Turks wearing the crimson fez; a rich man
&ldquo;clothed in purple and fine linen,&rdquo; mounted on a
smartly caparisoned white ass, and a poor man on foot, ragged and
tattered; camels and donkeys carrying loads of timber and
brushwood, to the peril of wayfarers; Egyptian, Copt, Armenian,
Greek, the black Nubian, the white Circassian, with groups of
veiled women, shuffling over the stones in gay slippers&mdash;all
these made a motley picture, which dazzled the attention of
pilgrims from England.&nbsp; At length we reached our hotel, and
had to make ladder-like ascents, and mount on roofs, story after
story, before we could get to our apartments, whence we caught
our first view of Mount Olivet.</p>
<p>We met with Christian friends in the Holy City, and were
kindly invited by Dr. Gobat, Bishop of <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Jerusalem,
to spend an evening at his house, when he gathered together a
party consisting of the principal foreign visitors at the time,
most of whom were English.&nbsp; For two Sunday mornings we
worshipped at the church on Mount Zion, near the Episcopal
residence, and were glad of an opportunity to partake of the
Communion.&nbsp; I have always delighted in fellowship at the
Lord&rsquo;s table with Christian brethren of different churches,
who, under different forms of administration, worship and adore
the same Lord.&nbsp; Not only when travelling on the Continent
have I received the Lord&rsquo;s Supper at the hands of
Episcopalian brethren, but in England, on a few occasions I have
availed myself of a similar catholic privilege.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, let me relate a story I heard from
Dr. Rosen, the German consul, respecting the famous Sinaitic
MS.&nbsp; Tischendorf had reason to believe a precious treasure
was hid in the monastery at Sinai.&nbsp; He obtained letters
which he thought would assist him, but, on further consideration,
declined to employ them.&nbsp; He found in the library part of
his coveted prize; and, it happened at that moment, the office of
Okonomos was vacant, and a keen contest for it was going on
between two monks.&nbsp; He joined one party, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and
promised to use influence with the Russian Emperor in favour of
their candidate, hinting that the present of a valuable MS. would
promote their object.&nbsp; After a good deal of diplomacy this
plan prospered.&nbsp; The MS. coveted by the scholar was secured,
and the once hopeless candidate was installed in office.&nbsp;
This was not all.&nbsp; The MS. was incomplete, and the missing
part was found by Tischendorf in the possession of a Greek
merchant.&nbsp; The promise of a Russian title proved more
effectual than gold, and Tischendorf carried off his prize to St.
Petersburg in triumph.&nbsp; I jotted down the story the evening
Dr. Rosen related it, and here in a few words have I given the
substance.</p>
<p>Of course we explored Jerusalem as far as our limited time
allowed; and, under the guidance of Dr. Rosen, I had the
privilege of visiting certain spots where recent discoveries had
been made.&nbsp; I remember seeing what looked like indications
of a well, from which, it was easy to imagine, people, in our
Lord&rsquo;s time, used to draw water.&nbsp; Nor can I forget
rambles on the line of walls commanding views of the city and
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I can now distinctly recall my visit to a
sepulchre outside the city, where a stone, like a large
millstone, was <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>lying at the door, as if recently &ldquo;rolled
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; I studied (as well as time, and what I had
read on the subject, would allow), the question as to the place
of crucifixion, and where our blessed Lord rose from the
dead.&nbsp; Points still remain to be settled, as to the
direction in which the city wall ran in the time of Christ.&nbsp;
I cannot adopt any modern theories on the whole subject, which
have made way in America and in England.&nbsp; It appears to me
after long study, that grounds can still be maintained in support
of the old tradition in favour of the spot where the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre stands.&nbsp; We made a memorable excursion to
Bethlehem, by way of Rachel&rsquo;s sepulchre, and descended the
cave where, it is said, our Lord was born.&nbsp; We next
proceeded to Hebron, where I stood by a flight of steps leading
to the tombs within, longing to ascend and explore those hallowed
resting places.&nbsp; Returning northwards, we stopped at the
traditional oak, by which Abraham sat in the heat of the
day&mdash;and at the vineyards of Eschol where old stocks are
thriving still&mdash;and at Solomon&rsquo;s pool and gardens, not
far from David&rsquo;s hiding-places.&nbsp; Then, after a long
and exciting day, we found rest in the old monastery of S. Saba,
from the terrace of which, we <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>caught a view of the Dead Sea.&nbsp;
We rambled on its melancholy shores, dipped in the Jordan, and
then spent a night by the ruins of Jericho.</p>
<p>The order of our journey followed Dr. Stanley&rsquo;s
directions, that we might have the advantage of crossing Olivet,
so as to come suddenly on the point where our Lord &ldquo;beheld
the city and wept over it.&rdquo;&nbsp; From Jerusalem we
proceeded northwards by Bethel, Sychar, Samaria, Esdraelon, and
Nazareth, to Tiberias and the Lake.&nbsp; Thence by Safed we
travelled over the hills of Galilee to Banias (&ldquo;the Syrian
Tivoli&rdquo;), Damascus, and Beyrout.&nbsp; Banias is a charming
spot.&nbsp; With the scenery from a hill overlooking Damascus I
was charmed beyond measure, and was intensely interested in the
antiquities of that grand old city.&nbsp; Dr. Allon, Dr. Bright
and Mr. Wilson visited the ruins at Baalbec, but Mr. Kemp-Welch
remained with me in Damascus to take care of Dr. Spence, who was
very ill.&nbsp; He had to be leisurely taken over the mountains
to Beyrout, approaching which we had never-to-be-forgotten views
of the beautiful Mediterranean.</p>
<p>After leaving Palestine I wrote in my notes the following
impression as to the Bible, which had been a constant companion
and guide in our travels:&mdash;It is the Book of the Holy
Land&mdash;the gospel of Palestine.&nbsp; <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>It is
Oriental; it is Syrian; it is Samaritan; it is Galilean; it is
Jewish.&nbsp; It paints the scenery of the Land of Promise from
end to end, and the wilderness too.&nbsp; It echoes the voices of
the people.&nbsp; We hear in it the murmur of towns and villages,
we pass through; it breathes the pure, fresh, bracing air of the
desert; everywhere as I opened the Divine pages I found them
reflecting surrounding scenes.&nbsp; Even the brilliant
Frenchman, who has tasked his genius to demolish the authentic
life of Jesus and to build out of the ruins an imagination of his
own, virtually admits the truth of what I have now advanced, for
he points out the minute accuracy of the Volume; which shows how
true in detail are the Gospels, how faithful to rock and stream,
river and lake, tree and wild flower, is the entire
narrative.&nbsp; Thus, after all he says to the contrary, he
really raises in the reader&rsquo;s mind a fair presumption of
its fidelity in higher matters.</p>
<p>One circumstance struck me as very noticeable&mdash;that is,
the compression, within a small compass, of a number of stirring
incidents related in Holy Writ.&nbsp; Dothan, where Joseph sought
his brethren and their flocks; the plain of Megiddo, the
battle-field of Israel; the river Kishon, &ldquo;that ancient
river,&rdquo; so fatal to Sisera&rsquo;s army; the valley of
Jezreel, with its wide <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>panorama, where Ahab had a palace;
the heights of Gilboa, where fell Saul and his sons, with the
well of Harod at the foot, where Gideon&rsquo;s three hundred men
stooped and lapped the water; the garden of the Shunamite,
opposite to Mount Carmel; the city of Nain and the cave of Endor;
Tabor and Nazareth&mdash;all these spots come within a few
hours&rsquo; ride.&nbsp; Well might Issachar think &ldquo;that
rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our party began to separate at Beyrout.&nbsp; Dr. Spence,
accompanied by Mr. Wilson, returned direct to England; the rest
of us came home through Europe.</p>
<p>In crossing the Mediterranean with Dr. Allon and Kemp-Welch we
touched at Cyprus.&nbsp; The coast looked flat and uninteresting,
but the bright morning, the sparkling sea, and the manifold
associations attaching to the islands inspired great curiosity
and deep interest, though I felt by no means well.&nbsp; I began
to be conscious that my appetite for travelling had somewhat
palled, if not become almost dead.&nbsp; We landed at Larnaca,
and found it a very poor place.&nbsp; The Greek churches were
somewhat curious, from the circumstance of old columns with
characteristic capitals being built into the walls.&nbsp; I
noticed Greek priests sitting in wine shops, and some of them <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>occupying
places of traffic, selling different articles in huckster-like
hovels.&nbsp; These men indicated the social degradation of
inferior orders in the Eastern Church.&nbsp; However it may be
with the dignified clergy in Russia, certainly priests in
Palestine, Syria and the Mediterranean Isles afford low types of
civilisation.&nbsp; After dwelling on what is related about
Cyprus in the Acts of the Apostles, the conversion of Sergius
Paulus, and the conduct of Elymas the sorcerer, became very real
narratives; and with these memories in our minds we re-embarked
and had a pleasant evening as we sat on deck.&nbsp; I fell asleep
with the prospect of reaching Rhodes the next day.</p>
<p>The harbour, with its well-known mole and adjuncts, is very
picturesque.&nbsp; We climbed up narrow streets, full of houses
once occupied by the knights, and from the fortification, had an
extensive view of the island and the Mediterranean.&nbsp; The
Church of St. John, blown up by gunpowder, and shattered to
fragments, seized on my imagination for a good while, as I
wandered, and sat down on a spot, so rich in romantic
story.&nbsp; We then returned to the interior of the town, and at
the harbour watched the boatmen, busy at the seaside.&nbsp; As we
were doing so, one of my companions exclaimed, &ldquo;Stoughton,
you&rsquo;ve got the jaundice!&rdquo; <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>and, sure enough, when we reached
our steamer, the looking-glass proved this was true.&nbsp; When I
rose next morning my limbs were of a saffron colour.</p>
<p>The weather changed.&nbsp; The sky was dark, and the views we
caught of Asia were by no means inviting.&nbsp; At night there
came a storm; and a storm in the Mediterranean is no trifling
matter.&nbsp; Wind roared through the rigging; the vessel lurched
and laboured, groaning as if the timbers would burst.&nbsp; Lying
in my berth I could feel the dashing billows.&nbsp; Tables and
stools were sliding about.&nbsp; The suspended lamps swayed to
and fro, like the pendulum of a clock.&nbsp; Overhead confusion
was terrible.&nbsp; Horses were kicking, and the sailors were
swearing.&nbsp; We had a pasha with his harem on board, and, as
might be expected, they were exceedingly terrified.&nbsp; Crowds
of pilgrims returning from the Eastern celebration at Jerusalem,
were lying on deck resembling herrings in a barrel, and the noise
they made was terrific.&nbsp; Waves beat over our boat, till the
poor creatures were almost drowned.&nbsp; Beside we had horses,
bears and monkeys on board, and, of course, they added to the
inharmonious concert.&nbsp; I rose from my hammock early, and
with my companion, Mr. Welch, sought comfort <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>from a cup
of tea.&nbsp; Reaching the deck, I talked with one of the
engineers, an Englishman, and asked what he thought of the
storm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there any danger?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; He
replied, &ldquo;This has been a very queer night, and we have
made no way.&nbsp; If it had lasted, that would have been
serious.&rdquo;&nbsp; We safely reached Smyrna harbour in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>Of course, I thought as we approached land:&mdash;There, on
one of the hills yonder, the martyr, Polycarp, by death sealed
the truths which he had proclaimed in life.&nbsp; As we landed, I
thought myself in an Italian port, so European at a glance
everything looked&mdash;houses, shops, and people&mdash;but,
entering the town, the scene changed, for there the streets,
bazaars, and costumes told of Oriental manners and customs.&nbsp;
The next day a party was organised to visit the ruins of
Ephesus.&nbsp; It can be reached by railway, and when we entered
the station, we might have fancied ourselves at home; for there
we met with English guards, and railway porters, like our
own.&nbsp; We had a special train to convey us to the far-famed
ruins.&nbsp; We visited what is left of the forum, the theatre,
and the stadium, but it is difficult to identify anything; and it
seemed to me, a definite idea of what Ephesus was in its <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>glory is
impossible.&nbsp; The view from the loftiest eminence is
magnificent, including the vast plain, the winding river Cayster,
and what, in Paul&rsquo;s day was the harbour of Miletus.&nbsp;
At the time of our visit, Greek Christians were celebrating the
Festival of St. John, on a lofty hill, the church there being a
rude-looking structure.&nbsp; The cave of the seven sleepers was
pointed out, on our way back to the railway station, and by the
cave is a beautiful mosque of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning we embarked at Smyrna for
Constantinople.&nbsp; We faintly discerned in the far distance,
as we crossed those classic waters, point after point closely
connected with ancient story.&nbsp; Of course, all the way,
amidst Homeric scenes and associations, we called them to mind by
Homer&rsquo;s help; but the thought of St. John&rsquo;s labours,
his epistles, to the seven churches in the Apocalypse, more
prominently occupied one&rsquo;s mind on the Lord&rsquo;s day,
when we had worship in the saloon, and I preached, as well as I
could, to a few sympathetic fellow-passengers.</p>
<p>On Monday morning early, we reached the Golden Horn, filled
with shipping.&nbsp; Caiques were quietly gliding over still
waters; but we were troubled at the Custom House by an ignorant
soldier, who laid <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>hold upon my &ldquo;Homer&rdquo; and detained it for
two or three days.</p>
<p>Kemp-Welch was the only member of our party left, the rest
proceeding homeward by another route.&nbsp; I made the most of
what was possible during the four days spent at
Constantinople.&nbsp; My friend and I followed the circuit of the
city on horseback; through Stamboul, which appeared very
Oriental, ruinous and dirty&mdash;through lines of cypresses,
near cemeteries with turbaned headstones; and so, all round, till
we reached the sweet waters.&nbsp; There we tarried a while,
looking at the gardens, and their summer houses, called
kiosks.&nbsp; The place is a resort like Hampton Court.&nbsp;
Thence we returned to the city.&nbsp; Next day we crossed the
Golden Horn, and saw the Sultan&rsquo;s seraglio, attached to
which are more gardens and more kiosks.&nbsp; The place contains
a library full of Arabic MSS., and a throne room, with the
Sultan&rsquo;s divan, surmounted with a baldacchino.&nbsp; There
His Majesty used to hold his court, attended by janissaries, and
was screened from the view of subjects, except that his hands
were visible.&nbsp; The Sublime Porte is the grand entrance to
the room of audience for ambassadors from other courts.</p>
<p>We visited the arsenal with its ammunition, muskets, and
swords.&nbsp; The building, it is said, was <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>in the
fourth century a church&mdash;the Church of S. Irene, where
Chrysostom preached some of his wonderful sermons&mdash;and it
has still in the apse an antique cross.&nbsp; But the grand
ecclesiastical edifice of Constantinople is S. Sophia, with
columns brought from Ephesus, and representations of four
cherubim with their faces obliterated.&nbsp; A legend is
preserved to this effect, that when Constantinople was taken by
the Turks, a priest was saying mass&mdash;immediately a chasm
opened in the wall and received him.&nbsp; There he still
remains, chalice in hand, waiting to finish the service, when
Christians recover the ancient edifice.</p>
<p>But I must not enter into further details of what I saw and
heard during my short stay at Constantinople.&nbsp; I was now
left alone, as my only remaining companion was obliged to return
home by a different route.</p>
<p>Let me add in closing this part of my story, that the banks of
the Bosphorus on which I gazed, as I left Constantinople,
surpassed previous imagination.&nbsp; The gardens and kiosks by
the waterside, looked paradisaical; and as we steamed along I was
enchanted, one instant after another, by objects on the
shore.&nbsp; All the way to the Black Sea was delightful.&nbsp;
Then surroundings changed.&nbsp; Travellers, <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>landed to
find themselves amidst indescribable confusion.&nbsp; Thence we
proceeded by rail across a dreary district, without trees, and
abounding in shallow sheets of stagnant water, with plenty of
storks, Egyptian geese, and other wild birds.&nbsp; Still, within
the region crossed, there were fields of grain.&nbsp; We reached
our steamer on the Danube, between six and seven o&rsquo;clock on
Friday evening.</p>
<p>We found the great river improve as we ascended it.&nbsp; At
first we had low banks dotted with mosques and minarets, showing
we were still in Turkey.&nbsp; On board the boat I was treated as
an invalid, and the attention shown by captain, crew, and
servants, was such as to inspire the warmest gratitude on my
part.</p>
<p>The scenery on the banks of the Danube, in the earlier part of
our voyage up the river, was very magnificent&mdash;rocks rising
loftily from the water&rsquo;s edge on one bank, but low on the
other.&nbsp; We passed richly wooded scenery, and caught glimpses
of pleasant glens, with running streams and picturesque
bridges.&nbsp; Further on were comfortable farm-houses and
smiling villages.&nbsp; We reached Pesth on Tuesday, travelling
by rail, and then proceeded, in the same way, to Vienna, where I
tarried for a couple of days&mdash;seeing the magnificent
cathedral, the vaults of the <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Capuchin Church, the Prater, the
Royal Palace, and the Picture Galleries.&nbsp; Travelling across
Germany by rail I reached the Rhine, thence to Brussels, where I
was entertained by my nieces then on a visit there.&nbsp; At last
I found two dear daughters waiting at the Victoria Station, and
at Fairlawn House, Hammersmith, there was a loving welcome.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of my narrative of Eastern travel, let me
remark.&nbsp; What one sees in travelling through Palestine gives
vividness to the narrative&mdash;makes what before were pale
outlines, pictures of glowing colour and dazzling light.&nbsp; I
do not forget the danger there is of being too much engaged with
what is outward in Biblical studies&mdash;tarrying in the porch
instead of worshipping in the temple&mdash;lingering by the hedge
to gather flowers instead of pressing into the field to cut down
corn&mdash;playing the geologist, instead of working as spiritual
miners&mdash;finding out what is curious as to literature,
instead of appropriating &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; But still, what I gathered in the East is
precious, and may minister to spiritual edification, as well as
to mental enjoyment.&nbsp; How marvellous it is that whilst the
Bible is so Eastern&mdash;while Oriental manners, customs, and
scenery are photographed there, it is nevertheless an universal
<a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>book!&nbsp; The Koran is not so Eastern as the Bible;
at least, so it struck me, as I read it in the East; yet the
Bible is the Englishman&rsquo;s book as the Koran could not be,
even if we were all Mussulmans.</p>
<p>Specially forcible and beautiful were the impressions we
derived touching the life of Christ; we felt how toilsome were
his journeys as He <i>walked</i> along the rough and rugged
pathways from Jericho to Jerusalem, over which we
<i>rode</i>.&nbsp; How humiliating must have been his intercourse
with the poor, who, no doubt, then lived in wretched mud hovels,
such as we saw, not only in Palestine, but in Egypt; types of
domestic habitation for the lower classes in ages past!&nbsp; We
thought: Through such collections of &ldquo;houses of clay&rdquo;
did He pass!&nbsp; Here did He tarry, and within such
abodes!&nbsp; Not one of them was His own; He had not where to
lay His head.</p>
<h2><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
1865&ndash;1872</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1867 I published the
first volumes of my &ldquo;Ecclesiastical History of
England&rdquo;; this calls for explanation of what preceded and
prepared for it.</p>
<p>Immediately after I left college, and settled at Windsor, I
commenced the study of Church history with much earnestness; and
the first fruit was a course of lectures on the subject to my
congregation, delivered on week evenings.&nbsp; When I had
completed them they were sent by me to my revered tutor, Dr.
Henderson, for criticism and advice.&nbsp; He encouraged me to
pursue my studies in that direction, with the hope and intention
of making use of them in after life.&nbsp; I followed his advice,
and during the remainder of my Windsor ministry devoted all the
time I could spare from pulpit and pastoral duties to researches
into early annals of Christendom.&nbsp; In my investigations I
was <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>kindly allowed to use the Dean and Chapter&rsquo;s
library.&nbsp; After I left Windsor, I turned attention to
ecclesiastical affairs during the Puritan period.&nbsp; This
happened just as I was about to pay a visit to my native
county&mdash;Norfolk&mdash;where I commenced studying original
records in Norwich.&nbsp; Proceedings <i>against
Nonconformity</i> and other records there came within my reach,
that part of England being somewhat rich in this department of
history.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spiritual Heroes&rdquo; was the title of my
first volume, which not long after was revised and enlarged in a
second edition.&nbsp; The Congregational lecture on &ldquo;The
Ages of Christendom,&rdquo; was delivered and published in
1856.&nbsp; This led, in 1867, to the &ldquo;Ecclesiastical
History of England, from the Opening of the Long Parliament to
the Death of Oliver Cromwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Church of
the Restoration,&rdquo; forming two volumes, appeared in 1870,
and &ldquo;The Church of the Revolution&rdquo; in 1874.&nbsp; To
complete the list of works on English Ecclesiasticism, there
followed other volumes on the reigns of Queen Anne and the Three
Georges.&nbsp; Afterwards came &ldquo;Religion in England from
1800 to 1851.&rdquo;&nbsp; I state all this, because some
confusion has arisen from a fragmentary publication of the
original works and of successive editions.</p>
<p>In 1867 correspondence and personal intercourse <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>commenced
between a distinguished Episcopalian and myself, of an
interesting character.&nbsp; In that year I received an
invitation to Chichester from Dean Hook.&nbsp; He was much talked
of, on account of his High Churchmanship, and his pre-eminent
activity as Vicar of Leeds.&nbsp; Dissenters counted him amongst
their bitter foes; and I should have been much surprised, years
earlier, had I been told I was to be a guest at his house.&nbsp;
Yet so it was.&nbsp; Historical sympathies brought us together,
and each found that the other wished to be fair in dealing with
men who held opposite opinions.&nbsp; Both believed in a
spiritual brotherhood reaching beyond denominational
bounds.&nbsp; Soon after my arrival at Chichester he asked:
&ldquo;What shall we talk about?&nbsp; If I thought I could make
you a Churchman, I would try to do so; and if you thought you
could make a Dissenter of me, you would make the
attempt.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied: &ldquo;Nothing of the kind; let
us leave out ecclesiastical controversy, and talk of literary and
religious matters, on which we are pretty well agreed; and when
we have exhausted them we will take up points of
difference.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went on to say, that his great friend
Lord Hatherley, then High Chancellor, differed from him
politically, and yet they had walked up together to the polling
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>booth to
record opposite votes, without any breach of friendship.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and I can unite to a
certain extent; and when we come to the parting of the way, we
can each take our own course, with mutual good will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I entered into the compact.&nbsp; On historical and social
subjects, and as to religion in its spiritual and experimental
aspects, we were of one accord, and felt no inclination to
unsheath swords.</p>
<p>We had pleasant drives in the country and cheerful chat at the
dinner-table, when he included within his party members of the
cathedral body.&nbsp; Plenty of anecdotes were related, some
about Dr. Wilberforce, when Bishop of Oxford.&nbsp; The Bishop, I
heard, used to tell a story, which showed how a man might,
unconsciously, make a good pun.&nbsp; He had engaged to dine with
somebody whose name was <i>Hunter</i>, a cattle grazier, and on
his way, as was his wont, the Bishop bethought himself:
&ldquo;What topic of talk can we have together?&rdquo;&nbsp; At
the railway-station his eye caught an advertisement of
&ldquo;Thorley&rsquo;s Food for Cattle.&rdquo;&nbsp; That would
suit very well.&nbsp; So the bishop asked the grazier his opinion
of such provision for beasts of the field.&nbsp; The host
replied: &ldquo;It might do very well for <i>Oxen</i>, but not
for a <i>Hunter</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not know he was quoting
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>the
diocesan name of his right-reverend guest (Oxon.), and forgot at
the moment he was also repeating his own.&nbsp; The Dean gave a
conundrum, invented by the Bishop, for the amusement of a young
lady:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part of your dress resembles two popular preachers
in the Church of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hook and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chancellor of the Cathedral, I think it was, spoke of
Wilberforce&rsquo;s power of adapting himself to people whom he
met.&nbsp; He liked to know beforehand who he was to see.&nbsp;
Introduced to a Yorkshire-man, he began to talk in the county
dialect.&nbsp; Visiting a screw manufactory, he won the
confidence of workmen by showing some knowledge of their
business.&nbsp; Once at the Earl of Derby&rsquo;s (grandfather of
the present Lord) he met gentlemen of the turf, and surprised
them by giving the pedigree of a celebrated racehorse.&nbsp; On
being asked how he came to be &ldquo;well up&rdquo; on such a
subject, he said he had gleaned knowledge of that kind as a boy,
in the stables of a trainer, near his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
He scarcely ever forgot anything he had heard.</p>
<p>The Dean was an early riser; and retired early to bed.&nbsp;
We had family prayer in the library about <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>nine
o&rsquo;clock, the family and the guests standing and kneeling
together.&nbsp; He read the Psalms for the day, and used parts of
the Morning and Evening Service.&nbsp; Once, about half-past ten
in the evening, I said to Mrs. Hook&mdash;a charming woman,
&ldquo;light of the dwelling&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I must bid the
Dean good-night.&nbsp; Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In bed and asleep the last hour,&rdquo; she gently
answered.</p>
<p>He told me that early rising had been his habit during his
residence at Leeds, and was so still; that demands on his time,
from forenoon to night, were such at Leeds as would have
prevented all literary work, had he not secured hours for study
before breakfast.&nbsp; Then it was he wrote his books.&nbsp; He
worked hard all day when vicar, and adopted unusual methods of
usefulness, holding something like Methodist class-meetings,
which took strong hold on his Yorkshire parishioners.&nbsp;
Familiar devotional gatherings he kept up at Chichester; and a
poor old woman was so delighted with them, that, by an odd
association of ideas, she compared them to feasting on
&ldquo;lamb and salad.&rdquo;&nbsp; These meetings he would
humorously call by that name.&nbsp; I had a good deal of talk
with my kind hostess about clerical incomes, and the <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>demands
made on them; and so I became disabused of false notions common
amongst outsiders.&nbsp; From what I heard of large outgoings,
payments on promotion, and so on, I am able to form a more
correct estimate of pecuniary affairs in the Establishment, than
I could before.</p>
<p>Considerable correspondence passed between us.&nbsp; A
friendly intercourse was also maintained by subsequent
visits.&nbsp; In a letter dated June 4th, 1867, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I like a companion who will look out for
points of agreement, and then coze upon them.&nbsp; I never court
the society of those who love an argument, and look out for
topics on which we disagree.&nbsp; You will, perhaps, infer from
this, that I want vigour of mind; but I really believe that many
minds are drawn out and strengthened by cozing instead of
arguing, and I am sure that this conduces to brotherly
affection.&nbsp; My wife and I after many years of hard
work&mdash;and what is worse than work, worry&mdash;came here to
retire from the world.&nbsp; We see little of general society,
and confine ourselves to pleasant cozy intercourse, with our
large and united family, and old friends.&nbsp; We cannot,
therefore, offer you any gaiety when you come amongst us, but if
you take us as we are, we shall hope to have some pleasant
cozes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>In a
letter, dated March 1868, he remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Peninsular War the pickets of the
two armies were accustomed often to meet on the most friendly
terms, and enjoy each other&rsquo;s conversation.&nbsp; But when
the trumpet sounded each man was at his post, ready to do his
duty.&nbsp; So it is with us.&nbsp; I have always acted on this
principle of refusing to admit the assertion, that our
differences are on nonessentials&mdash;and of offering,
nevertheless, the right hand of friendship in private to those
whom in public I might oppose, or rather by whom I was myself
opposed.&nbsp; I was freely censured at one time for this; but
when I left Leeds my Nonconformist friends rallied round me to
bid me farewell, and several of them saw I had pursued the right
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great thing which you and I have to do is to guard
against the deadly sin of too many of our
contemporaries&mdash;imputing motives.&nbsp; If we can discover a
good motive, we may rejoice, even though we condemn the action to
which it may have led.&nbsp; But no words can express, or thought
conceive, the indignation I experience, when men seek to
attribute good actions to bad motives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dean was not one of your modern correspondents.&nbsp; The
last of these extracts is from a <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>letter on quarto sheets, which
covers <i>sixteen</i> closely written pages.</p>
<p>Dr. Hook was a delightful talker, English to the
backbone&mdash;&ldquo;a thorough John Bull,&rdquo; as an Oxford
don once said to me.&nbsp; There was a strong dash of humour in
his constitution, and he was ready to tell amusing anecdotes of
himself.&nbsp; He was no ritualist, no Puritan, certainly no
Erastian; but a godly, warm-hearted, Christian man, whom it was a
privilege to know.</p>
<p>During visits to Chichester I became acquainted with one of
the canons, Dr. Swainson, then Norrisian Professor at Cambridge,
afterwards Master of Christ&rsquo;s College in that
University.&nbsp; He rendered me essential service whilst I was
writing my volumes on &ldquo;The Church of the
Restoration.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the books and MSS. in the
library of the cathedral were of great use; and when I visited
him afterwards at Cambridge he rendered me further valuable
aid.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of meeting some Cambridge dons at
his dinner table, and I remember being interested and instructed
by a long conversation on the rendering of names given in our
version of the Bible to ancient instruments of music.&nbsp; In
1869 I was present at the announcement of wranglers for that
year.&nbsp; I stood side by side with my friend <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>in the
gallery, close to the gentleman who held in his hand a paper big
with the fates of university competitors.&nbsp; It was a dark
morning, and at eight o&rsquo;clock, amidst breathless silence,
the personal secrets so many waited to learn, were publicly
proclaimed.&nbsp; It was a grand piece of living mosaic which lay
before me, as upturned eager countenances were fixed on the spot
where I was standing; and the announcement of the new senior
wrangler raised applause which seemed enough to lift the
roof.</p>
<p>My friendly relations with Dr. Swainson continued through
after-years; and his laborious investigations into Church creeds
were frequent topics in our conversation.&nbsp; His inquiries
into the date of the Utrecht MS. containing the &ldquo;Quicunque
vult,&rdquo; etc., were extraordinarily extensive, minute, and
careful, as I can bear testimony from repeated accounts he gave
of Continental journeys and inquiries.&nbsp; I apprehend that
nobody ever spent so much time and labour on the inquiry, as he
did; therefore his conclusions ought to carry much weight in the
settlement of a controversy touching historical theology, as well
as an arch&aelig;ological question.</p>
<p>On the occasion of my visit to Cambridge I went to see my
friend, Mr. Fordham of Melbourne, who possessed a valuable
collection of paintings; and I <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>mention him here, for the sake of
what he related respecting Lord Beaconsfield, who had been a
schoolfellow with Mr. Fordham&rsquo;s brother-in-law, the Right
Honourable Russell Gurney, Recorder of London.</p>
<p>They were educated at an academy in Walthamstow, kept by Mr.
Cogan, a Presbyterian minister, whose son I knew well.&nbsp;
Young Dizzy, as people called the politician, was famous at
school for two things.&nbsp; He delighted in forming parties and
getting up cabals&mdash;there was an embryo politician; next he
excelled in telling stories, and would keep the boys awake at
night by his romantic inventions&mdash;there was an embryo
novelist.&nbsp; He had early dreams of future greatness, I think;
and my friend informed me that he had talked to his schoolmates
of being one day Prime Minister of England.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1867&ndash;68, Dr. Alford, Dean of
Canterbury, delivered and printed a lecture on &ldquo;The
Christian Conscience,&rdquo; which was followed up, in <i>The
Contemporary</i> by an article expressive of kindly feelings
towards Nonconformists, and a desire for more friendly
intercourse with them.&nbsp; I felt it a duty to respond to this
overture, and did so, both privately and publicly.&nbsp; This
prepared for a friendship which <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>I highly valued.&nbsp; About the
same time, Archdeacon Sandford, father of the Bishop of
Gibraltar, made a move in the same direction.&nbsp; I spoke to
brethren in sympathy with myself, as regards union, and we
thought of inviting a few clergymen to meet us&mdash;when, on my
acquainting Dean Stanley with what we had in our minds, he
expressed a wish to take the lead by getting several friends on
both sides to dine with him at Westminster.&nbsp; Accordingly
Dean Alford, Archdeacon Sandford, Prebendary Humphreys, and other
clergymen, met my friends Binney, Allon, and others, at our good
friend&rsquo;s hospitable board; and the party proved most
agreeable.&nbsp; Other gatherings of the same kind followed, and
at Fairlawn, where I lived, a long conversation took place, when,
in addition to those just mentioned, Lord Ebury, Henry
Winterbotham, M.P., Dr. Angus, Dr. Rigg, Dr. Roberts, and my
intimate friend, Joshua Harrison, interchanged views in reference
to Catholic intercourse.&nbsp; Dr. Alford, the Dean of
Canterbury, afterwards invited Mr. Binney and myself to one of
his garden parties, and soon afterwards he presided at the
Cheshunt College Anniversary, when he uttered sentiments which
were followed by a pleasant response from ministers of different
denominations.&nbsp; On another <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>occasion he met the Professors of
New College, by invitation from the Coward Trustees; thus, and in
other and similar ways, brotherly intercourse was considerably
advanced.</p>
<p>If I may be permitted to trespass a little on what was at the
time in futurity, I will, for the sake of preserving connection
between incidents at that period, mention other circumstances
which brought together, in a friendly way, members of different
religious bodies.&nbsp; The first was of no great
importance.&nbsp; I think it was in 1870, the Archbishop of Syra
visited England, and made some little stir.&nbsp; Dr. Stanley
entertained him in the Jerusalem Chamber, and invited a larger
party to meet him afterwards.&nbsp; The host was not likely to
lose such an opportunity for bringing together people of
different opinions.&nbsp; Several were introduced to this
stranger, who occupied during his visit, perhaps, a position
above his usual one.&nbsp; The simple fact of this introduction
was magnified, by newspapers, even the <i>Times</i>, into a sort
of submission to Greek Archiepiscopal superiority; for the few
whose names were mentioned were represented as receiving his
formal benediction, and I wrote to explain the nature of the
interview, which really amounted to nothing more than a
respectful bow on the <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>part of an Englishman to a
foreigner, and the return on the foreigner&rsquo;s part of an
accustomed Greek salutation.&nbsp; The intended effect of private
civil reciprocities is often spoiled, by attributing to them
meanings never intended and utterly absurd.&nbsp; Reports of them
in quite a ridiculous way get into newspapers.</p>
<p>It was owing to the circumstance of my being
&ldquo;capped&rdquo; in Edinburgh at the same time with Matthew
Arnold, that I became acquainted with that remarkable man.&nbsp;
He was by no means popular with Dissenters, owing to what, in
some of his books, he said with reference to them.&nbsp; They
appreciated his ability, but censured the spirit which appeared
in some of his criticisms.&nbsp; My acquaintance with him
convinced me that in some respects he was misjudged.&nbsp; When I
came to know him pretty well, I playfully referred to some things
he had written, which stung people whom I knew.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I am not such a bad fellow,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;as
Dissenters think.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;but Dissenters look at you through your books; I look at
your books through you&mdash;and that makes a great
difference.&rdquo;&nbsp; I always found him kind, gentle,
tender-hearted.&nbsp; He sympathised with me in domestic sorrows,
and was pleased with some things I had written.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>The
publication of &ldquo;Ecclesia,&rdquo; a volume by Dissenters,
about the same time that another volume appeared written by
Churchmen, was the means of bringing the editors and writers of
the two works together at the house of a common friend, the Rev.
H. S. Toms of Enfield.&nbsp; The Rev. W. D. Maclagan, editor of
&ldquo;The Church and the Age&rdquo;&mdash;incumbent of a
neighbouring parish (afterwards Vicar of Kensington, then Bishop
of Lichfield <a name="citation176a"></a><a href="#footnote176a"
class="citation">[176a]</a>)&mdash;and Dr. Reynolds, of Cheshunt
College, were present.&nbsp; Each editor proposed success to his
brother editor on the other side.</p>
<p>This was an instance of mutual recognition and charity, worthy
of being known; standing out, as it does, in pleasant contrast
with bitter ways in which ecclesiastical controversies have been
too often waged.&nbsp; Nor did that single interview end the
intercourse thus begun, as I have had a few opportunities since
of kindly intercourse with Dr. Maclagan, both as Kensington
Vicar, and as a distinguished Bishop, earnestly doing his
Episcopal work.</p>
<p>Another event occurred about the same time, in favour of
union.&nbsp; The question of Bible Revision ripened to a
practical issue in 1870. <a name="citation176b"></a><a
href="#footnote176b" class="citation">[176b]</a>&nbsp; A
committee <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>was formed by Convocation to carry out the project, and
I had the privilege of being present during a part of the
discussion.&nbsp; I heard the Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Alford,
make an eloquent speech in favour of the design he had done so
much to initiate, and for the accomplishment of which he laboured
to the last.&nbsp; That speech was pronounced by some members as
the most effective he ever delivered.&nbsp; In the evening of the
same day, I came across Archdeacon Denison, at a clerical
meeting, to which I was invited by an old Kensington neighbour,
the Rev. J. E. Kempe, Rector of St. James&rsquo;,
Piccadilly.&nbsp; There is nothing like private chat with men of
pronounced opinions, who in public are accustomed to speak with
vehemence.&nbsp; Judging from newspapers, one regards them as
repulsive, whereas a little <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
in a quiet corner, makes a marvellously different
impression.&nbsp; It was so in this instance, and the fiery
Archdeacon, as I had thought him, proved a genial, humorous old
clergyman, joking me on misconceptions of character formed by
reading outside critics.</p>
<p>I must say, after all his antecedents, I found him a
thoroughly hearty and kindly disposed Englishman and
Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Revision,&rdquo; had <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>a powerful
and permanent effect in the relations of several distinguished
Churchmen and Nonconformists.&nbsp; Some of my scholarly
brethren, I need scarcely say, were chosen on the committee, and
nothing could be more harmonious than their co-operation on both
sides.&nbsp; Having enjoyed the friendship of some, and the
acquaintance of more, I can testify to their mutual regard and
affection.&nbsp; Some High Churchmen&mdash;as I know from having
seen notes in their handwriting&mdash;expressed thankfulness to
Almighty God for having brought them into this new
relationship.&nbsp; It evidently removed prejudices, and inspired
a feeling of religious oneness, where there had been before
estrangement, if not alienation.&nbsp; At the same time
Dissenting scholarship rose in estimation; and I found from
conversation, that Churchmen held their fellow-revisers in high
respect as critical students of the sacred volume.&nbsp; Some
betrayed their possession of an idea, that Nonconformist learning
in our day had risen far above what it was of old; an idea I
endeavoured to correct, by maintaining that, whilst there has
been a wider <i>diffusion</i> of knowledge amongst our ministers,
it may be questioned whether the attainments of living men
amongst us have not been exceeded <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>by those of a past generation.&nbsp;
Distinguished Hebrew scholars, such as Drs. Boothroyd, Pye-Smith,
and Henderson, famous in the early years of the century, are
dropping out of notice in the present day.</p>
<p>Social intercourse went on between the revisers and their
friends.&nbsp; Reunions were held at New College, and
Regent&rsquo;s Park College, and also in private residences.</p>
<p>An attempt on a bolder line to promote Christian union, came
into prominence about the time now under review.&nbsp; I allude
to a proposal for what has been called an &ldquo;interchange of
pulpits,&rdquo;&mdash;more properly an interchange of preaching
officers.&nbsp; A hundred years ago it was not altogether
uncommon for Incumbents of the Establishment to preach in
Dissenting chapels, especially those of the Countess of
Huntingdon&rsquo;s Connexion; in a few instances a Nonconformist
occupied a parish church pulpit.&nbsp; Such irregularities died
out early in this century.&nbsp; But twenty years since there
appeared a willingness on the part of several clergymen to revive
the practice.&nbsp; Conferences were held with reference to the
subject, and discussions occurred as to what measures should be
taken to secure legally, what seemed <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>desirable to many.&nbsp; The Right
Honourable Cowper Temple, afterwards Lord Mount Temple (now
deceased), took an interest in the matter, and prepared a Bill to
remove legal impediments out of the way.&nbsp; He sent me the
following note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My desire is to give power to the Bishop
and Incumbent to allow any minister of any denomination, or any
layman, to preach occasional sermons without requiring the person
who preaches to do any of the things required of a Priest or
Deacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not touch the Act of Uniformity, but provide
for a case which is not included in its provisions&mdash;that of
preaching sermons which are not part of the daily Church Service,
though they may be delivered at the same time.&nbsp; All that is
wanted is the admission that preaching in a church belonging to
the Establishment is not exclusively a function of the
Established Church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I insert a copy of the Bill which he sent me.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;A <span
class="smcap">Bill</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To enable Incumbents of Parishes, with the approval and
consent of the Archbishop or Bishop of the Diocese, to admit to
the Pulpits of their Parish Churches persons not in Holy Orders
of the <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>Church of England, for the purpose of delivering
occasional Sermons or Lectures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas it is expedient that facilities should be given
for the occasional delivery of Sermons in Churches of the Church
of England by persons not in Holy Orders of the Church of
England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it therefore please Your Majesty,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it may be enacted, by the Queen&rsquo;s Most
Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as
follows (that is to say):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; It shall be lawful for the Bishop of any
Diocese in England, on the application of the Incumbent or
Officiating Minister of any Church or Chapel belonging to the
Church of England within his Diocese, or for the Ordinary of any
Collegiate Church or Chapel, to grant, if he shall think fit,
permission under his hand to any person, although he is not in
Holy Orders and has not made or subscribed a Declaration of
Assent in the terms set forth in &lsquo;The Clerical Subscription
Act, 1865,&rsquo; to preach occasional Sermons or Lectures in
such Church or Chapel; and thereupon it shall be lawful for the
person mentioned in such permission, on the <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>invitation
of the Incumbent or Officiating Minister, to preach an occasional
Sermon or Lecture in such Church or Chapel without making any
subscription or declaration before preaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; The preaching of an occasional Sermon or
Lecture, in pursuance of this Act, may take place in any Church
or Chapel either, after any of the Services in the Book of Common
Prayer, or at a time when no Service is used, as may seem best to
the Incumbent or Officiating Minister of such Church or
Chapel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Bill did not propose liberty for an Episcopalian
incumbent to preach in a Nonconformist edifice&mdash;that object
could be sought afterwards&mdash;and the limited freedom
contemplated by the proposed measure failed to receive
parliamentary support.&nbsp; The fact was, Members of Parliament,
who were Dissenters, did not take up the question with any zeal,
and some were decidedly against the proposal.&nbsp; They felt no
more desire to see Nonconformists in Church pulpits than the
Established clergy and laity did; though, of course, they took a
different ground of objection.&nbsp; Lines of division remained
strongly marked, and those who aimed at Disestablishment were
bent on a more sweeping change.&nbsp; The time had not become
ripe even for so small <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>an alteration, and as there seemed
no great willingness in any party to promote the proposal, it
came to an unfortunate end.&nbsp; All kinds of means for
promoting union have been suggested, and I have supported some
very earnestly; but, in my old age, I am persuaded there is truth
in the remark: &ldquo;The more we grow in knowledge and advance
in love, the more we should strive to preserve that simplicity,
which is so peculiarly the characteristic of the Gospel, and the
more we should guard against <i>the uncharitableness of supposing
that every other view</i>, <i>except our own</i>, <i>must be
useless or erroneous</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation183"></a><a
href="#footnote183" class="citation">[183]</a></p>
<p>The year 1871 was marked by an educational measure, opening
Oxford to all denominations more fully than it had been.&nbsp;
The Bill met with opposition from the Marquis of Salisbury and
his friends.&nbsp; Some time before I had been requested by Lord
Ebury to draw up for the Ritual Commission an account of
Nonconformist modes of communion.&nbsp; The account is printed in
the Report for 1870 (p. 139).&nbsp; Now I received a note from
the Marquis, who had obtained a committee for collecting
information, asking me to give evidence with regard to matters
referred to them.&nbsp; Accordingly I attended.&nbsp; After
listening to what Dr. Jowett, Master of Balliol, <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>had to say,
I took my seat, to answer their Lordships&rsquo; queries. <a
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a>&nbsp; I had looked forward to
examination as somewhat formidable, but found it far
otherwise.&nbsp; It turned out to be a pleasant conversation.</p>
<p>When the Bill came under discussion in the House of Lords, I
felt an interest in the debate, and consequently attended as a
listener.&nbsp; After Lord Carnarvon had spoken, he stepped over
to the spot where I stood, saying that his desire had been not to
say anything discourteous to Dissenters.&nbsp; I received from
him afterwards a note, written in the same spirit, and expressing
a desire for the maintenance of friendly relations.&nbsp; About
the same time it happened that a course of lectures was given on
&ldquo;Christian Evidences,&rdquo; in which bishops and other
clergymen took part with Dissenting ministers.</p>
<p>The British and Foreign Bible Society is a bond of social, as
well as religious, union.&nbsp; A dinner at Mr. George
Moore&rsquo;s house, Palace Gardens, was, at that time, an annual
institution, and after the Exeter Hall meeting in May, the
committee, speakers, and other friends, met under his hospitable
roof.&nbsp; The host appeared at his very best, frank, generous,
and kind&mdash;no affectation, no assumption; only a rich vein of
English geniality.&nbsp; <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>On his right hand at such occasions,
usually sat Lord Shaftesbury, on the left perhaps the Archbishop
of Canterbury.&nbsp; Without flattery, but in homely ways of
recognising service, the master of the table would call up one
after another of his guests, and after we left the dining-room,
we had family prayer together, a bishop and a Dissenter taking
part in conducting the worship.</p>
<p>In 1871 the Dean of Canterbury was suddenly taken to his
rest.&nbsp; The tidings gave great sorrow; and I felt it was due
to his memory that some Dissenting brethren should attend the
funeral.&nbsp; Harrison, Baldwin Brown, Newman Hall, and others
did so; I was invited by the family to be one of the pall
bearers.&nbsp; Dr. Stanley, Dr. Merivale, Dean of Ely, and
others, met in the good man&rsquo;s library, where his picture of
St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount,&mdash;on which he had spent some of
his last hours&mdash;stood upon the easel, and Walton&rsquo;s
Polyglot lay open at the Book of Exodus, where Dr. Alford had
been reading just before his death.&nbsp; Slowly and sadly we
walked into the cloisters, where places were assigned us, and the
procession moved into the cathedral.&nbsp; There Mrs. Alford,
with wonderful composure, joined in the solemn service.&nbsp;
Shops were shut, and the streets lined with people, as we were <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>conveyed to
St. Martin&rsquo;s Churchyard, where we joined in singing one of
his hymns, &ldquo;Ten thousand times ten thousand,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; He had expressed a wish to be interred there, and
wrote the following memorandum: &ldquo;When I am gone, and a tomb
is to be put up, let there be, besides any indication of who is
sleeping below, these words only: <i>Deversorium viatoris
Hierosolymam proficiscentis</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the inn of a
traveller who is on his way to Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter which I received from Canon Robertson, he said, in
reference to this inscription: &ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Bullock may be
able to tell you, that some one has discovered the source of the
words engraved at the bottom of the tombstone.&nbsp; My own
inquiries have been fruitless.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have not been able
to ascertain their origin.</p>
<p>A committee was formed to raise some testimonial to the
Dean&rsquo;s worth, and they invited me to join them.&nbsp; They
acted in correspondence with the Chapter, and it was determined
that a painted window should be placed in the cathedral, and that
it should contain symbols of the evangelists, and the scenes of
our Lord&rsquo;s Temptation, in the larger circles; whilst the
four smaller ones around, were to contain subjects showing that
He exercised miraculous power of the <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>same kinds, in which He refused to
exert it, at the Tempter&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>In the following year I lost a valued friend, member of our
Kensington church, Sir Donald F. Macleod, C.B., K.C.S.I.&nbsp; He
had occupied the position of Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjaub,
and met his death from a railway accident in December,
1872.&nbsp; He possessed a rare gift for putting himself into
kindly fellowship with those he ruled, whether rich or poor,
entering into their feelings and cultivating their regard so that
he acquired a widespread influence in the Indian province, which
might be called the country of his adoption.&nbsp; All the people
loved him as a friend and father; hence it was said, that if the
natives had to choose a prince, he would be their choice.&nbsp;
In a leading journal, the remark of an Indian gentleman was
preserved to the effect, that, &ldquo;If all Christians were like
Sir Donald, there would be no Mahomedans or Hindoos.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His private life was of a piece with his public career.&nbsp; He
had the power of making numerous friendships through the happy
blending of religion with an affectionate disposition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherever he went,&rdquo; said a relative, &ldquo;his
presence was like sunshine, and the sunshine was the reflection
of another presence, even of Him of whom it is <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>said,
&lsquo;In Thy presence is fulness of joy.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; As
he communed with us at Kensington, and was a personal friend, I
can bear testimony to his cheerful manners in company.&nbsp; His
tall, commanding figure attracted attention, and his calm,
pleasant utterances won all hearts, especially those of the
young, who would gather round him, attracted by the magic of his
sympathy.&nbsp; This Indian gentleman visited the Cripples&rsquo;
Home; this Oriental scholar addressed a class in the East of
London; this ruler, who might have died a rich nabob, gave away
the surplus of his income in acts of charity.</p>
<p>In 1872 an incident occurred of an amusing description, which,
as it has some significancy, is worthy of notice.&nbsp; A
paragraph appeared in a religious newspaper to the following
effect: &ldquo;The Revs. Dr. Binney, Dr. Allon, and Dr. Stoughton
have been, it seems, presented to His Grace the Archbishop of
Canterbury at Lambeth Palace, by that consistent advocate of
comprehension, Dr. Stanley, Dean of Westminster.&nbsp; It remains
to be seen whether the Archbishop will invite either of the
Doctors to preach in any of the Metropolitan churches, if not in
the Abbey, or in the Cathedral.&nbsp; The Act of Uniformity will
have to be repealed.&rdquo;&nbsp; If anybody who read this
announcement had been <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>acquainted with the circumstances,
he would have seen its absurdity.&nbsp; The visit arose from an
informal invitation to a party at Lambeth&mdash;from Dr. Tait,
who was well acquainted with all the three persons.&nbsp; They
needed no &ldquo;presentation,&rdquo; such as the newspaper
imagined.&nbsp; It is a curious fact, that, while some people
complain of Dissenters being ignored or repulsed by the upper
classes, when, instead of it, there is friendly recognition, the
complainants imagine that, if the two classes do meet, there must
be obsequiousness on the one side, and patronage on the
other.&nbsp; It is supposed an impossible thing, for a Dignitary
and a Dissenter to meet as gentlemen, without any professional
design; on the occasion referred to, ecclesiastical objects no
more entered the head of the host, as he welcomed us with
cordiality, than it entered the heads of his guests.&nbsp; It was
an affair of social courtesy, in which politeness on the one
side, I hope, was returned on the other.&nbsp; By the way, at a
Lambeth reception, after mingling with friends whom I had known
for some years, I heard Mr. Binney say to Bishop Wilberforce:
&ldquo;Are you not surprised to see us here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprised!&nbsp; Why, if you were not here, who should
be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>This
rejoinder puzzled my friend, when I ventured to add, &ldquo;I
understand your compliment, my lord, but at least you will
acknowledge, it is something new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not new,&rdquo; he rejoined, and laying his hand on
my shoulder, proceeded to say, &ldquo;What is right is not new:
is not righteousness as old as the creation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you consider it is right for us to be here,&rdquo;
I ventured to remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; delighted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one overhearing this colloquy, observed in a whisper,
&ldquo;He will talk in a different way in different
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly; but I believe there is force in
what I have heard his friends say&mdash;he was a man of
many-sided sympathy, thoroughly good-natured, fond of
approbation, wishing to stand well with everybody, and for the
moment <i>sincerely</i> meaning what he said.&nbsp; But he was
changeful and inconsistent, saying one day, under an amiable
impulse, what it was difficult to reconcile with his conversation
another day in different company.&nbsp; I knew little of him
personally as a man; but as a preacher, and author, I must say I
have derived no small advantage from his sermons and
addresses.</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>Further, in reference to Bishop Wilberforce, remarkable
stories were current showing what a marvellous gift of
extemporary eloquence he possessed.&nbsp; Archdeacon Sinclair
told me that once the Bishop came to a meeting of the National
School Society, totally unprepared, and whispered to him:
&ldquo;What points had I better take up?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Archdeacon mentioned two or three.&nbsp; Wilberforce a few
minutes afterwards rose, and delivered a speech on those very
points, as if he had spent the morning in preparation.&nbsp; Dean
Stanley told me that when the Bishop held a confirmation in the
Abbey, he asked, as they walked together up the nave, whether
there was any particular subject he would like to have
introduced.&nbsp; One was mentioned.&nbsp; Forthwith the Bishop
took it up in his address to the confirmed, in a way which led
his hearers to suppose he had carefully prepared what he
said.</p>
<p>Dr. Guthrie was one of the most genial men I ever knew; full
of anecdote up to the brim.&nbsp; Indeed his conversation almost
entirely took that form, and his racy way of telling a story gave
what he said an irresistible charm.&nbsp; He was far more
catholic than many of his brethren, and though he had respect for
his ecclesiastical party, his sympathies went far beyond his own
circle; and with reference <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>to the Established Church of
Scotland, though himself a <i>Free</i> Churchman, he cherished no
animosity, and was not <i>indisposed</i> to preach occasionally
in the old parish pulpits.&nbsp; His attachment to Evangelical
truth was very strong, and for any deviations from it he would
listen to no excuse.&nbsp; He visited some of my people at
Kensington, and that brought me frequently into his
society.&nbsp; How he used to talk of his visits to Mr. Disraeli
and the Countess of Beaconsfield, of the wedding of the Marquis
of Lorne, when he escorted the children of the family to Windsor
Castle, and was especially noticed by Her Majesty, and was
addressed as &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo; by somebody who thought him a
bishop; and of a dinner-party at Argyle Lodge, when he met Mr.
Bright, and could hardly get in a word himself, because the great
orator would talk so much!&nbsp; The last time I saw him was at
breakfast with me at my house, when I think he was more brilliant
and merry than usual.&nbsp; He knew I was entertaining thoughts
of retirement, and he strongly urged me to relinquish pastoral
duties and become an occasional preacher.&nbsp; Moreover he said,
&ldquo;It is better to be too early than too late in this
respect.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you give up so soon?&rsquo; one of
Her Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers once asked me; &lsquo;you have all
your wits about you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>replied,
&lsquo;and if I were to wait, as some do, till my wits are gone,
I should never give up at all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An important crisis in the summer of 1872, had occurred in the
history of New College.&nbsp; Dr. Halley from age and
infirmities, retired from the principalship.&nbsp; Dr. Newth was
chosen successor, and to fill up the chair, left vacant by my old
friend and tutor, the services of three London ministers were
called into requisition.&nbsp; Mr. Binney undertook the Homiletic
Class, Dr. Kennedy became Theological Professor in the department
of Apologetics, and I was invited to conduct instruction in
Historical Theology.&nbsp; My hands were pretty full, but this
was an engagement congenial to my taste, and for which I felt I
was better qualified than I had been at the time when an
invitation was given me to accept the office of principal. <a
name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193"
class="citation">[193]</a></p>
<p>The question of my retirement from the pastorate occupied my
thoughts at a later period, and I indicated this in a
communication to the Church through my deacons.&nbsp; That
communication was <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>met by a warm and earnest request that I would continue
at Kensington Chapel a little while longer.&nbsp; I consented to
tarry till the end of two years.</p>
<p>About the time just noticed, education in reference to public
schools assisted by Government grants was keenly discussed.&nbsp;
Those amongst Nonconformists who were disposed to accept State
aid in support of schools in which religion was taught were
regarded as acting inconsistently with their principles in
opposition to State endowment of Christianity.&nbsp; Into that
question it is unnecessary to enter here, but I repeat what I
urged at the time referred to, that Government aid and Government
inspection were co-extensive; that if Government assisted a
school, and inquired <i>exclusively</i> into the <i>secular</i>
instruction of pupils, the aid bestowed was to be regarded as in
aid of that alone.&nbsp; The separation in a school of religious
from secular instruction, appeared to me inconsistent with our
duty <i>as Christians</i>.&nbsp; In guiding the intellect of the
young, an infusion of Gospel truth is, I believe, of essential
importance.&nbsp; A declaration to the effect that the Bible
should be used in public schools was signed by several hundred
Christian ministers, and in that declaration I most cordially
joined.&nbsp; The severance of <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>revelation from other fundamental
grounds of youthful knowledge was, in my estimation, very
mischievous.</p>
<p>Mr. Forster was condemned severely by a large number of
Dissenters as being opposed to the interests of
Nonconformity.&nbsp; I have good reason for believing that he
wished to deal fairly between Church and Dissent.&nbsp; The
opinions of all parties had to be consulted, and it was no easy
thing for any man in his place to give universal
satisfaction.&nbsp; I conversed with him at the time on the
subject of his measure, and am persuaded he was honest throughout
the whole business.&nbsp; When the strongest feeling against him
existed, I know, from what he said to me, that he gave full
credit to his opponents for good intentions.&nbsp; Of some
friends we both knew, who differed from him widely, he spoke in
the kindest terms.&nbsp; When he was regarded as an enemy by some
Nonconformists, I was informed he attended a Nonconformist chapel
in the country during a summer holiday; and I know he helped the
pastor by pecuniary assistance,&mdash;that very pastor being my
informant.&nbsp; Mr. Forster never lost sympathy with
Quakerism.&nbsp; Our common friend, Mr. Braithwaite, a well-known
member of that denomination, spoke at his funeral; and an eminent
Baptist <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>minister told me of his pleasant visits to Mr.
Forster&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>Matthew Arnold proposed my name for election to the
Athen&aelig;um Club.&nbsp; The usual mode is vote by ballot,
which, on account of the number of candidates, occasions delay
for many years.&nbsp; But the committee have power to choose
annually nine members by special vote.&nbsp; I did not know fully
until the secretary wrote to me, that I had been so
elected&mdash;an honour to which I felt myself by no means
entitled.&nbsp; The influence of Dr. Stanley, Mr. Matthew Arnold,
and other kind friends, secured for me this great privilege,
which has been a source of literary advantage and pleasure to me
ever since.&nbsp; And I may here mention, from what occurred in
the proceedings of the committee, as I was told, Nonconformity
was, in my case, rather a help than hindrance; as the club, in a
catholic spirit, desires to have representatives of different
classes and opinions included on its rolls.&nbsp; On the same
principle not long afterwards Dr. Martineau was introduced to the
Athen&aelig;um.</p>
<p>I was surprised a few weeks after my election to receive an
invitation to the Academy dinner, and was pleased to learn from
one of the Academicians that this compliment, as well as the
preceding, <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>arose from the same spirit of catholic sociality.&nbsp;
Nothing but presence at one of these banquets can give an
adequate idea of their remarkable magnificence.&nbsp; A sudden
burst of light, just before speeches commence, has a magical
effect.&nbsp; Mr. Disraeli, then Prime Minister, delivered a
highly finished oration, after sitting silent and sphinx-like for
an hour before.</p>
<p>At an early part of the period to which this chapter belongs,
the famous volume entitled &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; was
published.&nbsp; It excited much controversy.&nbsp; I read it
with interest and attention.&nbsp; It has long been my habit, in
perusing works unfavourable to orthodoxy, to search in them for
admitted principles which, by a fair application, may be employed
in support of truths to which the author is regarded as being
opposed.&nbsp; In the work just mentioned there is a chapter on
what is called &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s Royalty!&rdquo; <a
name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197"
class="citation">[197]</a>&nbsp; Christ is represented as having
established in the world a new theocracy in describing Himself as
King of the kingdom of God; in other words, as a King
representing the Majesty of the Invisible Ruler of a
theocracy.&nbsp; He claimed the character of Founder, of
Legislator, and, in a certain high and peculiar sense, &ldquo;of
Judge of a new and <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Divine society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever might be the
views of the writer with regard to the nature of Jesus Christ,
such a position as he reached, seems to me to involve
Christ&rsquo;s true and proper Divinity.&nbsp; In other words, it
is tantamount to saying that &ldquo;Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
glory of God the Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember that at the time, whatever might be the tendency of
the work on the whole, I thought there were in it admissions of
such a nature as to afford a basis for convincing arguments in
favour of Evangelical Christianity.</p>
<p>One evening, at that time, I met Lord Shaftesbury at a
friend&rsquo;s house, and had a conversation with him on the
subject of the book.&nbsp; It is well known that, with the
impetuosity which was so natural to that great and good man, he
was swept along by a hurricane of indignation, which led him to
pronounce &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; a work of most pernicious
tendency.&nbsp; Of Lord Shaftesbury it might be said that he was
like a cloud which moveth altogether, if it move at all.&nbsp; He
could do or say nothing by halves; and however minds of a
different order might judge of his acts and utterances, there can
be no doubt that by the enthusiasm of his advocacy he carried
beneficial measures which otherwise might not have
succeeded.&nbsp; When I was talking with <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>him after
the manner just indicated and pointing out arguments which I
conceived might be constructed out of some of the writer&rsquo;s
admissions, he was evidently very restless, and expressed his
strong conviction, that the book deserved to be strongly
reprehended, in order to warn people against being led away by
its contents.&nbsp; In the course of conversation he manifested,
that he had not read what he so severely condemned.&nbsp; This
habit of condemning books without reading them, it is to be
feared, is too common in the present day.</p>
<p>Here let me add Lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s manner was not always
the same.&nbsp; At times he was gentle and exceedingly affable,
of which I remember an amusing instance.&nbsp; We were travelling
together from Peterborough, after a jubilee meeting of the
British and Foreign Bible Society in that city.&nbsp; He was
speaking of the profound ignorance of the upper classes
respecting the character and habits of Nonconformists; and I
ventured to relate to him, in illustration of what he had said
himself, a story which I had heard respecting his father, who was
Chairman of the Committee of the House of Lords.&nbsp; A
solicitor waited upon him to confer respecting a Bill, which was
coming before the Upper House, in reference to matters which
affected <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>the rights of Dissenters.&nbsp; The old Earl said to
this gentleman, &ldquo;I hear a good deal about these Dissenters,
and some things very strange.&nbsp; I have been told they are
people <i>who go about without clothes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Earl
laughed, and said, such a thing as I related was just like
him.</p>

201</span>CHAPTER X<br />
1873</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sixth General Meeting of the
Evangelical Alliance had been fixed for the year 1870, in New
York; but, owing to the war between France and Germany, it was
postponed to the autumn of 1873.&nbsp; Canon Leathes, Mr.
Harrison, and myself, received invitations from the American
committee, to attend the assembly; and, accordingly, we started
for our destination in one of the Cunard steamers at the close of
the month of August.&nbsp; With the exception of rough weather in
the earlier part, we had a fine passage.&nbsp; Going out we
touched on the Irish coast, and, it being Sunday, we landed and
spent the day on shore.&nbsp; We were on the coast of Waterford,
and found the country very pleasant.&nbsp; We attended church in
the forenoon, and afterwards took walks in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I had spent a week or more in Ireland <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>some few
years previously, and had then seen spots in the Green Isle,
which created a desire to see more.&nbsp; The city of Limerick on
the Shannon had given me delight.&nbsp; Dublin is a magnificent
city, and the object of my visit there had been to preach on a
special occasion in Dr. Urwick&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; I saw at
that time something of Irish society, and found controversy rife
between Protestants and Papists.&nbsp; I took an opportunity of
visiting the Killarney lakes, and found them all, and more than,
I had imagined.&nbsp; Nor could I fail to be amused with the
humour of carriage-drivers and other Irish people.&nbsp;
Returning to our steamer on Sunday afternoon, we started for New
York, and had, in the course of our voyage, rough weather and
smooth.&nbsp; For some-time it was
unfavourable&mdash;&ldquo;four-fifths of a gale&rdquo; somebody
said; but in the latter part of our trip we had charming
weather.&nbsp; Where the whistle at night had sounded like a wail
of distress, it was now felt to be means of safety.&nbsp; Flag
signals and rockets now and then relieved the tedium; so did the
gambols of porpoises.&nbsp; Moonbeams in a mottled sky, were
pleasant variations, as we steamed along at a rapid rate.&nbsp;
The night before we landed in New York harbour, the sun went down
like a ball of fire, the sea was intensely blue, whilst alive
with <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>little billows, like children at their sports; the bow
of the steamer was crowded by passengers looking out for the
pilot&ndash;a capital subject, I thought, for some clever
pencil.&nbsp; The next morning when we reached Sandy Hook, I
could not help comparing the coast scenery near us with some
views I had seen on the Bosphorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the <i>first</i> time I am in America,&rdquo; I
said to a Yankee fellow-passenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;you are now, sir, in the
land of the brave, the home of the free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harrison and myself were guests of the Hon. Mr. Dodge,
President of the American Evangelical Alliance.&nbsp; On our
arrival he conducted us to his country seat on the banks of the
Hudson, near Tarryton.</p>
<p>We were in the midst of charming scenery, immortalised by
Washington Irving; near the glen of &ldquo;Sleepy Hollow,&rdquo;
and the haunts of Ichabod Crane.&nbsp; By the little Dutch church
in the neighbourhood lies a cemetery, where &ldquo;the American
Goldsmith&rdquo; is buried.</p>
<p>We were driven to Sunnyside, where he lived and died, in an
old-fashioned Dutch-looking house, with picturesque gables,
bearing a seventeenth-century date.&nbsp; It is embosomed amidst
trees which so <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>overshadow the lawn and walks, that
&ldquo;Sunnyside,&rdquo; even when unclouded, can suffer nothing
from the blaze of day.&nbsp; Miss Irving, niece of the author,
and a friend of our host, welcomed us to this sylvan abode, and
showed us her uncle&rsquo;s library, writing table, and shelves
of books, just as he left them.</p>
<p>We should have been glad to remain longer at Mr. Dodge&rsquo;s
villa, but were anxious to reach Niagara, as soon as possible;
therefore, on the second morning after our arrival, Mr. Harrison,
with Newman Hall, who had accompanied us to America, embarked on
a steamer for the Catskills, on our way to the Falls.&nbsp; We
arrived at the Mountain House in the evening, having, in our
river voyage, been struck with the Hudson, as resembling in some
parts, a succession of lakes full of Italian-like beauty.&nbsp;
We spent a Sunday at our capacious resting-place, which could
accommodate four or five hundred visitors, and engaged in united
worship with Bishop Bedell, successor to Bishop McIlvaine, of
Ohio.&nbsp; He preached in the morning, and at his request, I
occupied the desk at night.</p>
<p>We did not reach Niagara till late on Monday, and heard the
roar of the cataract some time before our arrival.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>Niagara is a grand study, and we spent the greater part
of four days over it&mdash;the first in taking general views, the
other three in gathering up details.&nbsp; I sat down on the
rocks, and wrote my impressions from point to point.&nbsp; From
the suspension bridge, below the Falls, you have an inclined
plane of troubled waters.&nbsp; From the south side of Goat
Island, you have a still more striking view of the rapids, like
an arm of the sea, two miles in width, and in front it dashes
down the Horse Shoe Fall.&nbsp; Just at the edge it is a ridge of
emerald, tinged, or rather lined, with white.&nbsp; Then it goes
on in rows of streaks, white, white, white; at the bottom, the
flood vanishes in vapour.&nbsp; In the forenoon under sunshine
the picture is crossed by a rainbow.&nbsp; Beyond the mist the
river is a shifting floor of variegated marble.&nbsp; At a right
angle with the Horse Shoe, the American Fall is seen in profile,
from what is called, I think, &ldquo;Prospect Park.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The rapids below are finer than those above the Falls.&nbsp;
Those below are hemmed in by rocks; those above are bordered by
open country on both sides.&nbsp; Further on, below the Falls,
there is an enormous whirlpool.</p>
<p>Instead of a unity, I found Niagara manifold, varying as one
wanders about the banks.&nbsp; The channel here is worthy of the
stream.&nbsp; It is cut <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>into precipitous cliffs, picturesque
rocks, forests of trees, bridges, hotels and other houses.&nbsp;
In photographs and engravings, there is often but a tame outline,
with which the reality does not correspond.&nbsp; Of the upper
and lower Rapids, I prefer the former in one respect; it gives
good views of the foliage which fringes the water.&nbsp;
Emphatically, one may use the word <i>beauty</i> in reference to
the landscape as distinguished from the Rapids.&nbsp; Colours are
charming&mdash;greens of all tints; at sunset streaks of pink,
violet, lavender, lilac, along the edge of the Falls; azure tints
in the river; sky with crimson and purple flushes at
eventide.</p>
<p>At the expense of repetition, I will quote the words I find in
my notebook written on a rocky bank:&mdash;&ldquo;Opposite,
looking west, is the Canada side, skirted by thick trees, forming
a continuous border&mdash;the Horse Shoe form of a rocky ledge,
crossed by the sweep of water, would measure the third of a
mile.&nbsp; It still resembles a ridge of emerald, tinged, or
rather lined, with white.&nbsp; Then the flood plunges down, to
rise again from the bottom in columns of vapour.&nbsp; In
sunshine the whole is crossed by a wonderful rainbow.&nbsp; Then,
afterwards, it appeared to me like an altar of frosted silver,
spanning the end of a temple choir, sending up incense for ever
and ever!&nbsp; <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>Looking down into the precipitous gulf, formed by the
Canadian and American shores, one sees the river flowing on
steadily like a shifting floor of variegated marble,&mdash;green,
streaked with white.&nbsp; I shift my position, walking under the
trees of Goat Island, about a quarter of a mile from the Horse
Shoe, and sit upon a bit of tableland, forming what is called
Lunar Island,&mdash;dividing into two unequal limbs the watery
flood.&nbsp; At the bottom appears another rainbow.&nbsp; I shift
again, walking up the Goat Island, and cross a bridge over
Rapids, and then enter the grounds called (as just said) Prospect
Park; and there one faces both cataracts&mdash;the American in
profile, the Horse Shoe full face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suspension bridge crosses the whirling waters on which it
makes one giddy to look down.&nbsp; Then occurs a turn, where a
whirlpool is formed, and pieces of timber are swept round and
round by enormous eddies.&nbsp; Four days I spent at these
never-to-be-forgotten spots filled with marvels of Divine
creation.</p>
<p>My visit to Montreal was very short, but we saw enough to
indicate the city&rsquo;s prosperity; it underwent great reverses
afterwards.&nbsp; We were invited to the handsome dwellings of
several wealthy citizens, and witnessed much zeal in the cause of
religion.</p>
<p>On our journey from Montreal to Boston we <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>passed
through glorious scenery, some of it Swiss-like.&nbsp; There were
many tempting nooks furnished with hotels, winding roads leading
up to forests on the hills, groups of white houses with green
shutters, and a pretty church amidst them with a lofty
spire.&nbsp; There is a wonderful charm about New England
villages.</p>
<p>At Boston a cordial welcome was afforded by Dr. Dexter, who
hospitably entertained us.&nbsp; My first impression, derived
from what I saw of the city&rsquo;s less modern part, was that it
had an English look; but on further acquaintance, after seeing
its modern edifices, one receives the idea of a Continental
capital.&nbsp; I was delighted with what delights
everybody&mdash;the broad green common, adorned by goodly trees
and goodly mansions.&nbsp; Some of the public buildings in Boston
are very imposing: a Gothic church, built by Congregationalists,
cost, I was told, &pound;50,000; but since I was there I
understand a much nobler Episcopalian edifice has been
erected.&nbsp; On the Sunday morning I preached in a large
Congregational church, where the music and singing were of a very
superior kind, and the choir, I was told, cost a large annual
sum.&nbsp; On the Sunday evening I went to a Baptist chapel, and,
after sermon and prayers, a large number of the congregation
adjourned to a schoolroom, where something <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>like a
Methodist love-feast was held.&nbsp; I met in the town with a
nephew of Thomas Carlyle, who related to me that, while on a
visit to England, he called on his uncle, and was told it was
impossible to see him; Mrs. C. resisted as long as she could, but
submitted at last.&nbsp; The nephew was admitted to his
uncle&rsquo;s study, and the two relatives had a long talk to
their mutual satisfaction.</p>
<p>Dr. Dexter planned an excursion to Andover, where we were
received by the Principal of the College, the Venerable Dr. Park,
a celebrated scholar and divine, who took me a drive round the
neighbourhood, and pointed out the house of Harriet Beecher
Stowe, and the homes of people described in her books.&nbsp; We
had a delightful visit to a ladies&rsquo; school, where Mr.
Harrison and I received a cordial welcome.&nbsp; Our kind host
took us to his residence several miles off, at New Bedford, and
the next day conducted us to Harvard University, on the other
side the Boston river.&nbsp; There we were entertained by
Professor Abbot, who took care to show us a hall, built by a
namesake of mine.&nbsp; Best of all my associations with Dr.
Dexter and the neighbourhood was a most memorable day spent at
New Plymouth where he pointed out the localities of the Pilgrim
Fathers.</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>We
proceeded to New Haven, where we found at the station, Dr.
Porter, Principal of Yale University, waiting for us; we were
conducted through leafy avenues to the college buildings, and
there introduced to the famous American theologian, Dr. Bushnell,
with other celebrities.&nbsp; The students then assembled, and
listened to an elaborate speech by Dr. Dorner, the German scholar
and divine, who happened to be there on a visit, having come as a
delegate to the Alliance meetings.&nbsp; Yale College is a
venerable institution, standing among the foremost Universities
of the New World.&nbsp; The neighbourhood is interesting, and we
should have been delighted, had time allowed, to explore the
region where two of the regicides, Walley and Gough, concealed
themselves for two or three years in a cave, to which they gave
the name of Providence.&nbsp; One of them, Gough, suddenly
appeared, when a Puritan congregation was attacked by Philip of
Pokanoket, and delivered them out of his hands.&nbsp; He then
disappeared like the twin brothers at the battle of Regillus.</p>
<p>Having had our glimpse of New England, we hastened to
Philadelphia, to spend a quiet Sunday with a kind English friend,
Mr. Yarnell.&nbsp; Philadelphia <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>is magnificent, redolent of William
Penn&rsquo;s memory, who amongst colonial founders, stands unique
as a man of peace.&nbsp; He did not sweep away aboriginal savages
with sword and shot, but entered into treaty with them, under the
shadow of a spreading elm, which came to be held in great
veneration.&nbsp; Views in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, vie
with noble monuments, visible on every side, of commercial
civilisation and prosperity.&nbsp; The grand Masonic Temple had,
when we were there, been recently opened; and it is amongst the
finest structures in the city.&nbsp; But the Hall of
Independence, architecturally unpretentious, has greater
attractions for historic travellers.&nbsp; We were entertained in
German Town, a charming suburb, by the
Wissahickon&mdash;&ldquo;fit haunt&rdquo; for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
fairies, Peas-blossom and the rest, flowing through tangled
brakes, wealthy in wild flowers.&nbsp; Drives by the
&ldquo;wedded rivers&rdquo; as Whittier calls them, the
Schuylkill, and the Delaware&mdash;are enjoyments for high days
and holidays.&nbsp; One view of the city I caught from a hill
embosomed in trees.&nbsp; A long line of foliage from the tops of
which rise cupolas and steeples, reminded me of Damascus, with
its groves and gardens, mosques and minarets.</p>
<p>We saw something of private social life in German <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>Town.&nbsp;
Several families in the neighbourhood were invited to spend an
evening with us.&nbsp; It resembled a party on the Continent,
where eating and drinking are not of much interest.&nbsp; The
marked feature of the whole gathering was extreme yet tasteful
simplicity.&nbsp; Some ladies were sumptuously dressed, and
there, as in other places, appeared an eye for harmony of
colours&mdash;a special American endowment, which struck me
pleasantly.&nbsp; Manners were agreeable, and there was ease in
conversation&mdash;a rare enjoyment.&nbsp; The ladies were
self-possessed, and could hold their own, yet not rudely; and
their kindliness indicated personal interest, which made their
visitors feel at home.</p>
<p>We arrived at New York at the beginning of October, and were
entertained by Mr. Dodge at his princely residence in Madison
Avenue.&nbsp; Sir Charles Reed was guest there at the same time,
and the arrangements for our reception betokened a cordial
welcome.</p>
<p>In a &ldquo;History of New York,&rdquo; it is stated that
&ldquo;when Henry Hudson discovered the river, now bearing his
name, and Hendrick Christiansen, and Adam Block, followed up the
discovery, the island of Manhattan was made the chief dep&ocirc;t
of the trade, and Christiansen received the appointment of agent
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>for the
traffic in furs during the passage of the vessels to and from
Holland.&nbsp; He immediately set about the construction of a
small fort, with a few rude buildings, on the southern extremity
of the island, thus laying the foundation of the future
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In May 1626, Peter Minuet arrived at New Netherlands,
as Director-General, and immediately effected the purchase of the
island of Manhattan, from the Indians for goods and trinkets to
the value of sixty guilders or about twenty-four
dollars.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1628 a church was organised with
fifty communicants under the auspices of James Michaelius, a
clergyman from Holland.&rdquo;&nbsp; From these feeble beginnings
sprang the wharfs, the quays, the avenues, the squares, the
warehouses, the stores, the halls, the libraries, the museums,
the hospitals of New York.&nbsp; When shall we stop in the
enumeration of riches belonging to this Queen of the West?&nbsp;
Hence, too, we may say came the churches, the congregations, the
colleges, the schools, the reformatories and the religious
institutions, without number, which form the glory of that
Western Metropolis.&nbsp; The first meeting of the Alliance
Congress&mdash;for the expenses of which twenty thousand dollars
had been subscribed&mdash;was held in the hall of the Young
Men&rsquo;s Christian <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Association.&nbsp; The hall contains
fifteen hundred sittings, and was decorated with flags, flowers,
and mottoes.&nbsp; It was crowded in every corner, and the
spectacle from the platform was imposing, the audience being
composed, to a large extent, of representatives from the States,
and the principal nations of our Eastern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Dr. Adams of New York, an eminent Presbyterian pastor,
delivered an address of welcome.&nbsp; Elaborate yet unaffected,
scholarly yet not scholastic, fervent yet not rhapsodical, fluent
yet perfectly finished, pious without a particle of
fanaticism,&mdash;it laid hold on people present, and made an
impression talked of to this day.&nbsp; I have heard many a
courteous speech at the opening of large assemblies, but never
any thing like that, before or since.</p>
<p>The address of welcome was acknowledged in a hearty, but
inferior style, by English, French, Dutch, and German
delegates.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Professor
Christlieb, the German, grasping the hand of Pastor Fisch, the
Frenchman, &ldquo;I am glad to see as the firstfruits of this
gathering, that we Germans can clasp the hands of our French
brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning we assembled in Steinway Hall.&nbsp; After
prayer by Dr. Hodge of Princeton, Dr. Woolsey, Ex-President of
Yale College, a <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>distinguished student of International Law, took the
chair.&nbsp; The Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Payne Smith, read a
sympathetic letter from the English Primate, and immediately
after prayer, he solemnly repeated the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, in
which the whole assembly followed in audible tones.</p>
<p>The Conference then began with the reading of papers, which,
with addresses, were continued morning and evening at sectional
meetings.&nbsp; The interest was kept up, attention never seeming
to flag.&nbsp; When Sunday came, large churches were crowded to
excess.&nbsp; The Holy Communion was administered in the
afternoon, when Episcopal, Presbyterian, Baptist, Moravian, and
Indian brethren took part in the service.</p>
<p>Besides the sectional conventions, an enormous general meeting
was held in Brooklyn, when extempore addresses were delivered in
free and easy style.&nbsp; But perhaps the most deeply affected
audience was a crowded one in the Academy of Music the last
Sunday night, for prayers and short addresses.&nbsp; A prima
donna, I heard, was present: certainly there was one voice of
pre-eminent sweetness and power in that vast congregation.</p>
<p>All the newspapers gave reports of the proceedings as fully as
<i>The Times</i> does of our parliamentary <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>debates.&nbsp; One afternoon two gentlemen, who had
been clergymen, spent some time beforehand in preparing a report
of what I meant to say in the evening.&nbsp; There was no other
way, <i>they said</i>, of getting the report ready for the next
morning.&nbsp; The interest taken in our proceedings by all
classes greatly surprised me.&nbsp; Newspapers, representative of
churches out of sympathy with our proceedings, noticed and
criticised what went on: the secular press also took up the
matter, and conveyed abundant information.&nbsp; What appeared in
New York papers was transferred to others all over the States,
and thus religious news of that week spread far and wide.</p>
<p>The whole report, published afterwards, was a curiosity for
size and cheapness; but such voluminous accounts of a conference
must not be taken to mean more than this&mdash;that Americans
like to know whatever is going on, in every circle.&nbsp; It
appeared to me that our transatlantic brethren are so fond of
hearing public speakers, and of reading what they say, that they
do not confine their thoughts to such discussions as are germane
to their own convictions and tastes.&nbsp; They are curious to
hear what anybody has to utter, if he speaks to the purpose, no
matter what the topic may be.&nbsp; We should <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>be
mistaken, if we measured religious belief in New York by popular
attention given to the Alliance.</p>
<p>The President, Dr. Woolsey, was a distinguished constitutional
lawyer, consulted at times about international claims by European
authorities; numerous professors of erudition and power, authors,
orators, politicians, merchants, gathered round him in 1873; the
European continent contributed such men as Dorner, Christlieb,
and Krafft from Germany, Prochet from Genoa, Carrasco from
Madrid, Bovet from Neuchatel, Stuart from Holland.&nbsp; Some of
our own distinguished countrymen have been already
mentioned.&nbsp; Ward Beecher delivered a wonderful oration in
Dr. Adams&rsquo; church on the subject of preaching.&nbsp; He was
like a man stopping you in the street, and getting &ldquo;hold of
your button&rdquo; so as to compel attention.&nbsp; I met him
several times in America, and received acts of kindness, when his
face was lighted up with an expression of rare beauty.</p>
<p>Nor were churches and halls the only &ldquo;pleasant
places.&rdquo;&nbsp; One evening Mr. Dodge had a reception to
which eight hundred persons were invited, and at one moment, he
told me six hundred were actually present.&nbsp; Introductions,
handshakings, recognitions, questions, answers, observations and
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>stories
were incessant; whilst a band of musicians played at one end of a
suite of apartments, it could not be heard at the other.</p>
<p>On Monday, all the delegates were conveyed by special train to
Philadelphia.&nbsp; On the way we stopped at Princeton.&nbsp;
Students of colleges assembled at the station, and uttered their
characteristic cheers&mdash;in imitation of ascending and
descending rockets&mdash;followed by such huzzahs as we do not
hear in England.&nbsp; We marched in procession through the
streets to the church, where a crowded congregation awaited our
arrival.</p>
<p>We reached Philadelphia about three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There
a long train of carriages awaited our arrival to convey delegates
to the Hall of Independence.&nbsp; The city authorities
represented by one of the judges, expressed a welcome, after
which we were escorted to the Continental Hotel capable of
containing the whole party.&nbsp; We all started next morning for
Washington.</p>
<p>On the way we were delighted with surrounding scenery,
especially when we came to Chesapeake Bay, into which the
Susquehanna pours its waters.&nbsp; Woods were clothed with
autumnal tints, crimson maples flashed their fires amidst
manifold hues of decaying foliage; and the sunny prospect, as we
<a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>skirted
the bay, was beautiful beyond description.&nbsp; At the Baltimore
station brethren from Washington invested us each with a white
ribbon badge; then on we swept past homesteads, recently the
abodes of slaves, many a hut serving as an original illustration
for &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked in the train with a black bishop, who entertained us
with descriptions of negro excitability.&nbsp; He said coloured
congregations would exclaim in church, as the preacher proceeded
with his discourse, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Massa&rdquo;; and a
man once shouted, under the influence of what he heard,
&ldquo;Massa, that&rsquo;s like going up Jacob&rsquo;s
ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A distant view of the Capitol is not unlike that of St.
Peter&rsquo;s at Rome, as seen from the Campagna.&nbsp; We saw a
few city lions&mdash;the Capitol and Smithsonian Institute being
chief; and we found this metropolis, not without form, for it is
artistically laid out in thoroughfares radiating from the
Capitol; but it is certainly &ldquo;void,&rdquo; for nominal
streets were there, but at that time without houses.&nbsp; We
drove a long distance, across an open country, suggesting the
idea of a city which <i>is not</i>, but only <i>about to
be</i>.&nbsp; How it looks now, I do not know.&nbsp; Yellow dust
was blowing in clouds, and lying in thick drifts on the steps of
the Hall of Assembly.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>General Grant carried in his face the signs of an
indomitable will, and without any personal assumption behaved as
one conscious of representative power.&nbsp; After my return
home, Dr. Adams, who was then in England, told me that he acted
as chaplain to the forces at the time of the great war, and rode
by the General&rsquo;s side, when he reviewed the troops.&nbsp;
As illustrative of his memory for little things, I may refer to
the General&rsquo;s conversation with his old chaplain, when they
met in England, and he alluded to the colour of the horse, the
latter used to ride, informing him of the animal&rsquo;s death,
which had just occurred.&nbsp; The General seems to have
possessed the royal gift of not forgetting those to whom he had
been once introduced.&nbsp; Let me add, he was proud of having
commanded such an immense army as he did, and said to the Duke of
Wellington&mdash;who repeated this to Dr. Stanley, my
informant&mdash;&ldquo;Your father was general in chief of only
forty thousand men; I led as many as <i>half a
million</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We visited a great number of institutions in New
York&mdash;colleges, schools, hospitals, and reformatories.&nbsp;
Colleges, architecturally, were not imposing; but the libraries
and scientific apparatus possessed by some of them, were of a
choice and costly kind.&nbsp; <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>I was told of one gentleman who had
contributed &pound;100,000 to educational objects.&nbsp; Schools
are immense buildings; and at New York and Philadelphia it was a
sight indeed, to behold pupils, gliding to their appointed
places, and then upturning some eight hundred happy countenances
towards the visitors come to see them.&nbsp; The examination of
classes was most satisfactory, and the resources and adroitness
of the teachers most admirable.&nbsp; Hospitals in the city are
abundant, beyond what the necessities of the population seemed to
require, and the reformatories afforded encouraging examples of
discipline and improvement.</p>
<p>Parks and cemeteries are on a scale of such magnitude, and are
so picturesquely laid out, that English visitors surveyed them
with surprise.&nbsp; As to American scenery in general, justice
had never been done to it.</p>
<p>We felt gulpy in taking leave of friends, and ending a visit
so memorable.</p>
<p>The sea was calm, and the weather bright, as we steamed out on
our voyage home, but a gale followed, and we had violent storms
during several days.&nbsp; Serious accidents occurred in
consequence, which gave a maimed appearance to some of the
passengers.&nbsp; My dear friend Harrison had a serious
fall.&nbsp; Waves <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>rose many feet high, and they supplied a key to some of
Turner&rsquo;s sea pictures, and also to Ruskin&rsquo;s eloquent
language in describing the &ldquo;truth of water&rdquo;&mdash;the
power, majesty, and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable
sea.</p>
<p>A friendship I formed in America deserves a notice here, on
account of the person&rsquo;s eminence and the obligations under
which he laid me by his subsequent handsome gifts.&nbsp; Dr.
Sprague had the largest collection of autographs in the
world.&nbsp; The number was immense, amounting, I am told, to
about 100,000.&nbsp; He was living at Flushing at the time I was
in New York, and I had charge from a friend in England to call
upon him.&nbsp; Though having never met him before, yet from
previous knowledge of each other, we were at home, immediately
after I had crossed his threshold.&nbsp; It is an American
characteristic to treat as friend any one who has been known by
kindly report beforehand, or who can present credentials of
character.&nbsp; Dr. Sprague&rsquo;s wife and daughter received
us at once as if we had belonged to the family.&nbsp; We crowded
an immense deal of talk into a short space, and before we parted
he made reference to his huge collection of autographs.&nbsp; As
we had little time to spare, I had covenanted with my companion,
Mr. <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>Harrison, that I would avoid that tempting topic, as it
would detain us too long; but the ice being suddenly broken,
there was no help, and I found myself plunged&mdash;I must say
not unwillingly&mdash;into a subject which prudence had decidedly
proscribed.&nbsp; Dr. Sprague found that I was one of the craft,
but a minor member; and forthwith he profusely offered
assistance, asking whether there were any letters of his
countrymen I particularly desired to possess.&nbsp; What an
overture!&nbsp; I modestly replied, I should be glad of a few
lines written by Washington Irving.&nbsp; Before I left America
there came a most interesting letter from Irving to his
publisher, respecting a new edition of his works; and after my
return to England, post after post brought most valuable
contributions to my store of autographs.&nbsp; The very first
included a letter signed by General Washington of historical
value.&nbsp; It relates to the close of the War of Independence,
and gives direction for cessation of hostilities immediately
after the surrender of Lord Cornwallis, in 1781.&nbsp; Letters in
the handwriting of Franklin, Jonathan Edwards, and a number of
other celebrities, came to England from time to time, enriching
my stores, almost to the period of Dr. Sprague&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; He was a popular preacher, a distinguished divine, a
prolific <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>author, and a man of widespread influence in the
States.</p>
<p>In closing this account of American friends, I must say a few
words about members of Harvard University.&nbsp; I had met with
the Greek Professor at the Mountain House, on the Catskills, who
spoke much of the principal, Dr. Peabody, for whom I felt a high
respect.&nbsp; My friend, Mr. Harrison, and I were most
courteously received by the Doctor at his residence, and were
shown over the University buildings, especially that bearing the
name of Stoughton, a Governor of Massachusetts.&nbsp; I was
anxious to see the poet Longfellow, who resided in an
old-fashioned house not far from the college.&nbsp; Unfortunately
he was not at home, and I could not refrain from dropping him a
line.&nbsp; I received the following reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, <i>October</i> 7<i>th</i>,
1873.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have this morning had the pleasure of receiving your
friendly note, and hasten to say how much I regret that absence
prevented me from seeing you when you were in Cambridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have lived over again that bright summer
afternoon at Mrs. Fuller Maitland&rsquo;s, which <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>I so well
remember, and you would have told me of many friends whom I
should like to hear of again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I may still have the pleasure of seeing you
before you return to England.&nbsp; If not, I beg you to present
to Mr. and Mrs. Maitland my best regards and most cordial
remembrance of their kindness and hospitality.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;With greatest esteem,<br />
&ldquo;I am, my dear sir,<br />
&ldquo;Yours truly,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Henry W. Longfellow</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fuller Maitland, members of a well-known old
Nonconformist family, were members of my church at Kensington;
and at their house I used to meet distinguished and interesting
people.&nbsp; The occasion referred to in the foregoing letter
made upon me a most pleasant impression.&nbsp; A large company
had assembled to greet the American poet, and there was plenty of
handshaking, which I feared would rather weary him, especially as
so many of us were total strangers; but he assured me that I was
quite mistaken, and that it gratified him much to be surrounded
by so large a party, composed of those whom he regarded as
English <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>friends.&nbsp; Americans are in some respects more
cosmopolitan and genial in new society, than Englishmen, and I
was struck with this repeatedly in my transatlantic trip.&nbsp; I
was quite affected with the kindness met with everywhere.&nbsp;
Among those who showed special courtesy were some of the
well-known Abbot family, and other professors at Yale, Andover,
and Princeton, as well as at Harvard, and Mr. Winthrop, of Boston
fame.&nbsp; Before I conclude this account of my American tour,
one more incident remains to be mentioned.&nbsp; At some of the
meetings in New York, I met with an intelligent and interesting
Quaker.&nbsp; I found he was acquainted with Friends in England,
and in the course of conversation mention was made of the
Gurneys, when he informed me that Mrs. Gurney, widow of Joseph
John Gurney, of Earlham, was residing in the vicinity of
Burlington, in New Jersey.&nbsp; She was an American lady who
became the wife of the Norwich philanthropist, and retired to her
own country after her husband&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Finding that I
knew Mr. Gurney, his widow was informed of the circumstance, and
presently I received a kind invitation to visit her at her own
residence.&nbsp; My friend and I, after a pleasant journey,
reached the outskirts of Burlington, and were welcomed by <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>our hostess
at a handsome house with picturesque surroundings.&nbsp; We had
much conversation about Earlham, and I was shown into a
comfortable library stocked with books, brought from the Hall
which I had seen in my boyhood.&nbsp; She told me about a visit
which Mr. Forster, father of the distinguished politician, had
paid her, not very long before,&mdash;a visit speedily followed
by his death, and interment in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; On the
walls of the drawing-room I noticed a facsimile of the famous
letter written to Mrs. Gurney, by President Lincoln, respecting
the great war going on, in which the question of negro slavery
was so inextricably involved.&nbsp; She and some other ladies had
been favoured with a special interview on the subject of
emancipation, and it was to this interview, and its associations
that the facsimile referred.&nbsp; She asked, if I should like to
have a copy of it, and then not being able at the moment to find
what she sought, she took down the framed copy and presented it
to me as a memorial of my visit.&nbsp; I carefully brought it to
England, and as it is not known here, as it is in America, I
subjoin the contents, showing the importance which Abraham
Lincoln attached to the conversation of the zealous Quaker on the
occasion mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Esteemed Friend</span>,&mdash;I
have not forgotten, probably never shall forget, the very
impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a
Sabbath forenoon two years ago.&nbsp; Nor has your kind letter,
written nearly a year later, ever been forgotten.&nbsp; In all,
it has been your purpose to strengthen my reliance on God.&nbsp;
I am much indebted to the good Christian people of the country
for their constant prayers and consolations; and to no one of
them more than to yourself.&nbsp; The purposes of the Almighty
are perfect and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail
to accurately perceive them in advance.&nbsp; We hoped for a
happy termination of this terrible war long before this, but God
knows best and has ruled otherwise.&nbsp; We shall yet
acknowledge His wisdom and our own error therein.&nbsp; Meanwhile
we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting
that so working, still conduces to the great end He

could stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your people&mdash;the Friends&mdash;have had, and are
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>having,
a very great trial.&nbsp; On principle and faith, opposed to both
war and oppression, they can only practically oppose oppression
by war.&nbsp; In this hard dilemma some have chosen one horn, and
some the other.&nbsp; For those appealing to me on conscientious
grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I could, and can, in
my own conscience under my oath to the laws.&nbsp; That you
believe this I doubt not, and believing it, I shall still
receive, for our country and myself, your earnest prayers to our
Father in Heaven.</p>

230</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
1874&ndash;1875</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1874 I lost my old
friend, Thomas Binney.&nbsp; His pre-eminent position amongst
Dissenters was attested by copious notices in newspapers, and, by
the scene at his funeral.&nbsp; That position arose from several
causes&mdash;his character, abilities, pulpit popularity, and
personal appearance, manifold and far-reaching sympathies, and a
genial nature, characteristic of the best Englishmen.&nbsp; His
influence in the Congregational denomination throughout the
country was aided by the central position of the Weigh-House when
London was different from what it is now; <a
name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230"
class="citation">[230]</a> by strangers from the provinces who
flocked there as to a centre; by visits to various parts of the
country at Nonconformist festivals; and by the transfer of so
many members of his Church to other congregations <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>throughout
the land.&nbsp; Nor do I forget how his name came to be known,
beyond that of any other of our ministers, throughout the British
colonies, owing to his being the father and founder of the
Colonial Missionary Society, and the guide and counsellor of many
youths going to seek their fortune in America or the South
Seas.&nbsp; Still further was his popularity owing to a visit he
paid some years ago to Australia.&nbsp; Also, when I was in
Canada, I often heard of a less public visit paid to that country
at an earlier period.</p>
<p>Amongst the many subjects in which my friend felt interested,
was that of improvement in conducting Nonconformist worship; he
gave his views respecting it in an appendix to a work on
Liturgies, by the Rev. E. H. Baird of New York.&nbsp; I refer to
this subject particularly, because to a considerable extent I
sympathised with him; not, however, in consequence of his
arguments, but from previous convictions, which, during late
years, have become stronger than ever.&nbsp; The authority for
excluding all liturgical worship from our places of assembly,
neither he nor I could ever understand.&nbsp; I see nothing in
Scripture which ties a Christian down to this perverse
one-sidedness.&nbsp; On the <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>contrary, both methods are
sanctioned in the Old and New Testaments.&nbsp; My experience
since retiring from the pastorate has strongly confirmed my
previous impressions.&nbsp; When leading public worship, as I did
for so many years, my utterances of devotion were spontaneous,
and I am sure imperfect; but what was obvious enough before,
though sometimes overlooked, came home to my feelings when
listening to words in public devotion, often unadapted to inspire
or guide supplication and praise.&nbsp; Further, extempore words,
though <i>free</i> to the speaker, are, to all intents and
purposes, <i>a form</i> to the hearers; and if a form in
extempore speech, when thoroughly suitable, be proper, why is not
a form in written language?&nbsp; Since I have become deaf, and
often cannot catch a brother&rsquo;s supplications, a form which
I can <i>read</i> must obviously be preferable to one which I am
unable to understand.&nbsp; Extempore public devotion, under many
circumstances is of priceless value; but under some circumstances
so is liturgical service.&nbsp; Attempts amongst Dissenters in
the latter direction, I am aware, have in some instances failed,
owing largely to prejudices handed down through past generations;
until those prejudices melt away&mdash;some day perhaps they
will&mdash;an alteration, <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>such as to others like myself, seems
quite hopeless. <a name="citation233"></a><a href="#footnote233"
class="citation">[233]</a></p>
<p>In the years 1874 and 1875, I took part in commemoration of
two world-known Nonconformist celebrations.</p>
<p>The first was the unveiling of Bunyan&rsquo;s statue at
Bedford.&nbsp; I went down with the Dean of Westminster, Lady
Augusta Stanley, and Dr. Allon, who all did wisely and well the
parts allotted them.&nbsp; Her Ladyship gracefully unveiled the
bronze figure of the wonderful dreamer; and her husband uttered
immediately afterwards the following effective
words:&mdash;&ldquo;The Mayor has called upon me to say a few
words, and I shall obey him.&nbsp; The Mayor has done <i>his</i>
work, the Duke of Bedford has done his,&rdquo; (he gave the
statue,) &ldquo;and now I ask you to do yours, in commemorating
John Bunyan.&nbsp; Every one who has not read the
&lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo; if there be any such
person, read it without delay; those who have read it a hundred
times, read it for the hundred and first time.&nbsp; Follow out
in your lives the lessons which the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress&rsquo; teaches; and then you will <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>all of you
be even better monuments of John Bunyan, than the magnificent
statue which the Duke of Bedford has given you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dean and Dr. Allon delivered elaborate addresses at the
Corn Exchange, and it was allotted to me, to propose, after a
public dinner, &ldquo;The Memory of John Bunyan.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
thought struck me, that his genius was equally imaginative and
realistic.&nbsp; People rise from reading his dream, with
impressions of character, as lively as those derived from
perusing Shakespeare or Scott.&nbsp; They see in his delineations
just such folks as walked the streets of Bedford, and plodded
through Midland country lanes, two hundred years ago.&nbsp; I
heard gentlemen at table say they thought Bunyan took his
conceptions of scenery from neighbouring places.&nbsp; But I said
I did not think so.&nbsp; He had never beheld hills like
&ldquo;the Delectable Mountain,&rdquo; nor a vale or plain like
that of &ldquo;Beulah.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, he took his scenery
from Scripture, and gave it reality by allusions such as we
employ, when touching on objects of every-day life.&nbsp; He was
&ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evangelist,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Greatheart,&rdquo; all in one&mdash;a pilgrim to the
Heavenly City and a preacher of the Gospel.</p>
<p>I may here add that two years afterwards brazen <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>doors were
given to Bunyan meeting by the Duke, and were opened with due
solemnities, the Mayor and Corporation attending on the
occasion.</p>
<p>The unveiling of Baxter&rsquo;s statue at Kidderminster
occurred in July 1875, when Dr. Stanley represented the Church of
England at the request of the town authorities; and, at the same
time, they requested me to speak on behalf of
Nonconformity.&nbsp; It was a gala day; shops were shut, flags
were hung out, people wore holiday clothes, and a procession of
the Corporation, the Bishop, and the speakers marched to the spot
where the statue was placed.</p>
<p>Soon after the Kidderminster celebration I visited a worthy
friend of mine at Bridgenorth, the Rev. Daniel Evans.&nbsp;
Whilst there I received a letter from Dr. Stanley saying that he
had heard me mention a design I had of visiting Madeley.&nbsp; He
said he found in his interleaved Bible, opposite Dan. iii.
19&ndash;27, the words &ldquo;Fletcher of Madeley,&rdquo; and
asked if I could discover at Madeley a key to this enigma, as it
seemed to him.&nbsp; Mr. Evans and I had visited Madeley
together, and in conversation recalled to mind an anecdote in
Benson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Fletcher.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man
threatened to burn his wife if she went to hear the vicar
again.&nbsp; She went notwithstanding, and the preacher chose for
his <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>sermon one of the lessons for the day, instead of the
text he had thought of previously.&nbsp; The lesson was in Daniel
on the deliverance of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from the
fiery furnace.&nbsp; The man followed his wife at a distance to
find out what it was in Fletcher&rsquo;s preaching that so
attracted her.&nbsp; When the poor woman returned she found her
husband on his knees praying by the side of the fire he had
prepared for her martyrdom.&nbsp; I wrote to the Dean and told
him the story, as recalled to my mind by my friend Daniel
Evans.&nbsp; The Dean sent back his kind regards and thanks to
<i>Daniel</i>, &ldquo;who had discovered his dream and the
interpretation thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have brought the Bunyan and Baxter celebrations together
because of their similarity; and the Madeley incident because it
became connected with the last of them.</p>
<p>In 1874, the year between the two celebrations, I resigned my
charge at Kensington, when a meeting was held to present a
testimonial, to which Archdeacon Sinclair contributed, and the
Dean of Westminster, with other Churchmen, besides Nonconformist
friends in large numbers, uttered loving words I can never
forget.</p>
<p>The following report appeared in <i>The Times</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dean Stanley and the
Nonconformists</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thursday evening, April 15th, 1874, the Rev. J.
Stoughton, D.D., an eminent Dissenting minister at Kensington,
retired from the pastorate of his congregation there, after a
connection with them extending over the long period of
thirty-three years, during which he has had the reputation, while
upholding the principles of Nonconformity, of maintaining the
most kindly relations with the neighbouring clergy, and is
understood to have enjoyed the respect of the whole community of
Churchmen as well as Dissenters.&nbsp; The ceremony of last
evening was held in Kensington Chapel, a handsome building in
Allen Street, Kensington, where Dr. Stoughton has long
ministered, and his congregation attended in great numbers on the
occasion.&nbsp; Mr. Samuel Morley, M.P., acted as chairman, and
there were present, among others, the Dean of Westminster, Sir
Charles Reed, Sir Thomas Chambers, M.P., Mr. James Spicer, the
Revs. W. H. Fremantle, M.A., J. Angus, D.D., W. M. Punshon, D.D.,
Donald Fraser, D.D.; F. J. Jobson, D.D., Henry Allon, D.D.,
Samuel Martin, and J. C. Harrison, the last-named of whom, on
being called to address the meeting, took occasion to <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>say that
their reverend friend, Dr. Stoughton, though acquainted with
every form of religious thought, had ever held fast to the
Gospel; that, as a minister of religion, it had been quite a
passion with him to be thoroughly fair and impartial; and that he
had all along panted for union among all religious
denominations.&nbsp; Later in the ceremony, the Dean of
Westminster, having been called upon to speak, presented himself
to the meeting, and was much cheered.&nbsp; He said there might
perhaps be several reasons why he had been asked to address
them.&nbsp; He could not plead the same long acquaintance as the
previous speakers had claimed with their venerable pastor; but
still, during the last few years of his acquaintance with him, he
could truly say that there had been no occasion of joy or sorrow
in his life on which he had not received some kind sympathy from
him.&nbsp; There was another reason for his addressing the
meeting.&nbsp; As a Churchman, and as a minister of the Church of
England, he felt called on to express his gratitude towards one,
not exactly of his communion, who had never once let fall from
his lips a word of bitterness against the community to which the
Dean belonged, and through whose heart he verily believed the
destruction of Westminster Abbey would send a pang.&nbsp; He only
<a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>trusted
that when the twenty-first century arrived, and some future
pastor of the chapel should write the history of Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s reign, he would treat his communion with the
same courtesy and appreciation as their present pastor had
treated, alike, divergent ministers and pastors of the Church of
the Commonwealth.&nbsp; He felt he had come there that evening
not so much as a personal friend or as a minister of the
Established Church, but rather as her representative of common
friends through the writings of Dr. Stoughton and himself.&nbsp;
He came there to express obligations which dear old friends of
them both, who lived two hundred years ago, would have wished to
express on an occasion such as that&mdash;Chillingworth, Jeremy
Taylor, Sir Matthew Hale, and many more whom his friend had
brought to one common platform.&nbsp; They had had before his
time histories of the Puritans, where they heard of nothing but
Puritans; they had also histories of the Church of England; but
the work of Dr. Stoughton was the first that had brought those
famous men together.&nbsp; There was, he knew, a charge brought
against his friend and himself that they were not sufficiently
good haters.&nbsp; However that might be, he was sure that Dr.
Stoughton hated, as he did, party spirit, the want of candour, <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>all
untruthfulness, and insolent vulgarity, whether in Church or
Nonconformity.&nbsp; All these the Dean hated with a detestation
so complete that, if it were possible, he would be willing to
curse them thirteen times a year.&nbsp; He could not part from
that assembly or from that occasion without saying one word on
the peculiar aspect of the farewell on which the previous
speakers had so touchingly dwelt.&nbsp; Surely it was a
transition of life which all of them might envy as they
approached the term of their allotted existence, to be able to
secure for themselves a margin of life and of comparative quiet
before the great end came at last.&nbsp; There was a custom in
old monasteries&mdash;he trusted it would not be altogether
inappropriate to mention it at a meeting of
Congregationalists&mdash;that when any of the ancient monks had
served a term of thirty or forty years&mdash;he forgot
which&mdash;they were then to be relieved altogether from their
arduous labours; they were to be called by a gentle name which
meant &lsquo;playfellow&rsquo;; and one condition of their
existence was that nothing that was disagreeable should ever be
named in their company.&nbsp; Such to their friend Dr. Stoughton
was the tranquil period through which he was now passing; and
although they might still anticipate for him long years of <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>active
usefulness, whether by pen or by voice, there must be a
delightful sense on his part in looking forward, having
accomplished one period of his existence, to a more undisturbed
time in which he might look back on what had been, and forward to
what was to be to him and all alike.&nbsp; The Dean&rsquo;s
speech, of which this is necessarily a summary, was repeatedly
cheered during its delivery.&nbsp; A valedictory address,
expressed in flattering terms, and reviewing the long connection
between their pastor and the congregation, was afterwards
presented to Dr. Stoughton by Mr. R. Freeman, on behalf of the
Church and congregation, accompanied by the spontaneous gift of a
purse containing &pound;3000.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides others who were present on the occasion, as noticed in
<i>The Times</i>, let me mention my excellent friend and
neighbour the Rev. J. Philip Gell, formerly Vicar of St.
John&rsquo;s, Notting Hill.&nbsp; He referred to the well-knit
efforts of pastor and people, which had constituted the strength
of the Church at Kensington, and remarked that it was little
known how the force of public opinion acts and reacts on the life
of a large permanent congregation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The love which
was thrilling that night was the Church&rsquo;s strength, and so
long as that lived and flowed on <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the part of the people, and was
sustained by the pastor&rsquo;s wisdom, so long would the Church
live and prosper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Morley Punshon, President of the Wesleyan Connexion,
travelled from Leeds, where he had preached that morning.&nbsp;
He trusted that the Church would be Divinely guided in choosing a
successor.&nbsp; It was encouraging to witness such a
presentation as that just made, the like of which many present
had never seen before.</p>
<p>The years I spent at Kensington were very happy.&nbsp; I can
say from experience that the life of a Congregational minister,
in connection with a large and liberal Church&mdash;when full
play is given to the social affections, elevated and purified by
culture as well as religion&mdash;is an enviable lot, and calls
for the devout gratitude of any one who has enjoyed it.</p>
<p>The friendships formed with many of my flock, a very few of
whom are still living, have been amongst the choicest privileges
afforded me by Divine Providence.&nbsp; Loving memories of them
linger in my heart, amidst sweeping obliterations of names and
faces incident to an age of fourscore and more, and those who
survive me will, I trust, accept an acknowledgment of obligations
deeply felt as these lines are written.&nbsp; I took special
interest in some, now goodly <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>matrons, who were school girls at
Kensington in my time, and whose happy fortunes I have
sympathetically followed through life.&nbsp; If they read these
lines, they will understand the fatherly feeling with which they
are written.&nbsp; Their parents, now at rest in the eternal
home, were no small joy to me, and as they passed away, one after
another, they left blanks not to be filled up in this world.</p>
<p>Two deceased friends I may here notice.&nbsp; At an early
period in my Kensington pastorate, a gentleman called upon me in
the vestry with a transfer to our Church from a communion he had
joined in Manchester.&nbsp; At the time he was a rising engineer,
and afterwards took part in the construction of railways over the
Alps and in South America.&nbsp; He was a botanist, and came to
possess a large garden and conservatory where he lived.&nbsp; He
received the honour of knighthood, and as Sir James Brunlees
became well known.&nbsp; He took a deep interest in our
Congregational affairs, and after his change of residence from
Addison Road, Kensington, still continued, with his family, to
worship with us on Sundays.&nbsp; He was an intimate friend of
John Bright, both of them being anglers; and I was entertained by
stories of their success, as brethren of the rod.&nbsp; I often
spent a few restful days at <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Argyle Lodge, where he and his
kind-hearted lady made me as much at home as I felt at my own
fireside.&nbsp; She died suddenly, after my retirement, when she
was visiting a friend.&nbsp; I was immediately summoned to meet
and comfort the mourning family.&nbsp; Another
friend&mdash;George Rawson, of Bristol, the gifted
hymn-writer&mdash;also died after my retirement, leaving memories
of intelligence, humour, and affection, which I shall fondly
cherish as long as I live.&nbsp; His beloved wife, daughter of
the Rev. John Clayton, one of my predecessors in the Kensington
pastorate, died some years before at Bristol.&nbsp; The touching
memory of her funeral, and of the company then present, passes
before me as I write these lines.</p>
<p>When I wrote this chapter, I asked my dear daughter Georgie to
give me some results of her own experience whilst visiting the
poor.&nbsp; She returned the following notes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Instances of unselfishness are sometimes
very touching.&nbsp; I knew a Christian woman who suffered for
years with weak sight, and had several operations on both eyes,
so that she could only distinguish outlines of different
objects.&nbsp; She heard of two little children, distant
relations of her husband, being left orphans, and as she had no
children of her own, she suggested that they should adopt these
little <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>girls, and lead them in early years to a knowledge of
Christ.&nbsp; The husband was so touched at his wife&rsquo;s
readiness, with failing sight, to take this burden upon herself
that, though a common labourer, he was willing to incur the extra
expense, and ever since that home has been one of the brightest I
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor woman expressed a strong desire that some one
would speak to her sailor boy, who was wild and
unmanageable.&nbsp; An opportunity occurred not long after, but
the lad manifested great disgust at being talked to, and
afterwards whenever I called he left the room.&nbsp; When about
to start upon a voyage, I went to bid him
&lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo;&nbsp; On leaving I said, &lsquo;The time
may come when you will feel the need of a true friend; remember
that Christ is ready to receive you, for He has said, &ldquo;Him
that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These words may fill your heart with gladness some
day.&rsquo;&nbsp; I did not hear anything of him for a long time,
but one evening I received a note saying he was lying ill in a
hospital, and would I go and see him.&nbsp; I complied, and found
he had never forgotten the Saviour&rsquo;s words which I had
quoted.&nbsp; He resisted, he said, the voice calling him to
forsake his sins and cleave to Christ till he could bear it no
longer.&nbsp; At last he yielded, and the change produced in him
was <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>remarkable.&nbsp; During a long illness he manifested
patience, unlike his old self, and the lad&rsquo;s cheerfulness
and readiness to help his mother were very beautiful.&nbsp; He
died in her arms, singing &lsquo;Safe in the arms of
Jesus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the poor have seen days of prosperity, and have
forgotten God; but, when adversity comes, like frightened
children, they rush to the Father&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; One man,
possessing at one time over &pound;20,000, with a hundred men
under him, lost all.&nbsp; Then, when reduced to the greatest
distress, he listened to the Divine voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that on Lord Chichester&rsquo;s library
table there always stood a large card, with the words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Jesus, make Thyself to me<br />
A living, bright reality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And such words unite the rich and the poor.&nbsp; One
of the poorest women I ever met, had a strong realisation of
Christ&rsquo;s constant presence; and it so beautified her life,
that all who entered her humble home felt such a prayer had been
answered in her experience.&nbsp; I never talk to her but my mind
is carried back to the Stanmer library.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of this chapter, which closes my Kensington
ministry, I venture to speak of my methods of preaching.</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>The
main object of my ministrations was the illustration of
God&rsquo;s Holy Word.&nbsp; Archbishop Whately preferred
&ldquo;to set his watch by the sun&rdquo;; and, therefore, tested
the results of his own thinking, and other teachers, by a
comparison of them with the decisions of Scripture.&nbsp; When
Scripture was plain, the subject on which it pronounced a
distinct judgment was regarded as fixed for ever.&nbsp; That
method it was my desire habitually to pursue.&nbsp; I made it my
aim, not only to interpret the meaning of a particular verse
taken by itself, but to catch, and fix in my mind, the
<i>drift</i> of Apostolic thought in particular instances.&nbsp;
It has been said, irreverently, that some expositors, when
persecuted in one verse, flee to another, and the connection
between the several parts of a paragraph is overlooked and
lost.</p>
<p>It was my desire to look at long <i>trains of thought</i> in
the writings of St. Paul as a sacred landscape, in which here and
there a verse occurs as a lofty hill, which serves as a
commanding point for surveying a landscape of thought round
about.&nbsp; A single verse is often a key to an entire
paragraph.</p>
<p>It was my habit to go over now and then a large extent of
Scripture&mdash;doctrinal, biographical, historical.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stars of the East, or Prophets and Apostles,&rdquo; formed
a series of personal sketches in the Old and New <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Testaments,
afterwards published by the Religious Tract Society.&nbsp;
Another course, called &ldquo;Lights of the World,&rdquo; were
illustrations of character, drawn from records of Christian
experience and action, such as &ldquo;William Tyndale, or Labour
and Patience&rdquo;; &ldquo;Richard Hooker, or a Soul in Love
with God&rsquo;s Law and Holy Order&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Robert
Leighton, or the Peacefulness of Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides such methods I did not scruple to lay under
contribution to the pulpit, condensed summaries of Puritan works,
such as Baxter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Now or Never&rdquo;; also I may
mention that a course of Sermons on &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress&rdquo; excited much interest, and three or four of these
I repeated at the close of my pastorate.</p>
<p>As to the real value of a sermon, form must never be
confounded with substance.&nbsp; It is vain to vote the mantle
into majesty.&nbsp; A royal robe depends for effect on the
richness of the material, not on the adjustment of its
folds.&nbsp; Toller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sermons&rdquo; <a
name="citation248"></a><a href="#footnote248"
class="citation">[248]</a> so eulogised by Robert Hall, depend
for their impressiveness, not on a careful selection of
words&mdash;in this respect they are open to criticism&mdash;but
upon the intrinsic majesty of such thoughts as they express.</p>
<p>There is an obvious contrast between French and <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>English
preachers in this respect.&nbsp; They are more attentive to form
than we are.&nbsp; I have witnessed effects in Parisian, and in
Italian churches as well, produced by modes of delivery, such as
I never saw in our own country.&nbsp; Young preachers in England
might make their sermons more effective than they are, by greater
attention paid to a mode of delivery.</p>
<p>Let me add a word or two as to preparation from week to
week.&nbsp; At the beginning of a week I chose subjects for the
following Sunday; and then gathered up from day to day, in
reading and talking, arguments and illustrations suggested by
books, scenery and conversation.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s mind may be
brought to such a state as to gather together what is valuable
and useful from time to time, as the magnet attracts to itself
grains of precious metal over which it sweeps.&nbsp; And, let it
not be forgotten, we may sometimes <i>build</i> up a sermon by
adding one thought to another; and at other times <i>plant</i> a
sermon through an idea which takes root and grows into a goodly
tree.&nbsp; My method then was, on a Saturday evening, to
<i>review</i> and revise what I had prepared, to criticise its
substance and arrangement, and alter it in matter and form, so
that on Sunday morning it could be poured out to the people in
freshness and force.</p>
<p>On week-night services, I sometimes took up <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Church
history, or arch&aelig;ological illustrations of the Bible.&nbsp;
Bible-classes, of course, were held; but in the latter part of my
Kensington pastorate, I was greatly helped in this, as in other
respects by my worthy friend, the Rev. J. Alden Davies, who was
for a few years my assistant minister. <a
name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250"
class="citation">[250]</a></p>
<h2><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
1875&ndash;1879</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my last chapter I brought
together two celebrations&mdash;one in honour of John Bunyan, the
other in honour of Richard Baxter.&nbsp; Another celebration now
claims attention, not of an English Nonconformist, but of a
Protestant Reformer, whose fame covers the world&mdash;Martin
Luther.&nbsp; English commemorations of his character and work
were held late in 1875 and early in 1876.</p>
<p>Before I mention any particulars respecting the Luther
celebration, I repeat what I have said elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no other man of a similar order
whose fame touches so many topographical points, and sweeps over
so wide a surface.&nbsp; The local reminiscences of Shakespeare
and Milton, even taken together, are few, and cluster round a
metropolis, a provincial town, and two or three <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>villages.&nbsp; But how many cities, castles, and
houses there are in Germany scattered far and wide which may be
said to have Martin Luther for their presiding genius!&nbsp;
Guide-books call attention to some spot where he went, some
fortress or tenement which gave him shelter, some church in which
he preached, some locality which his name has made famous; and
there are scenes and houses unmentioned in guide-books, over
which lingers the spell of his memory.&nbsp; One comes across
mementoes of Charles V. in divers directions; but even they are
fewer, less interesting, and less honoured than those of the monk
who gave the emperor so much anxiety, and who by his devotion,
and energy accomplished the reformation of the Teutonic
Church.&nbsp; Certainly no king, no kaiser, can vie with him as
to the place he occupies in the thoughts of his own people, and
indeed of the whole Christian world.&rdquo; <a
name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252"
class="citation">[252]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Washington Irving concludes his essay on &ldquo;Shakespeare
and Stratford-on-Avon,&rdquo; by remarking it would have cheered
&ldquo;the spirit of the youthful bard that his name should
become the glory of his birthplace, that his ashes should be
guarded as a most precious treasure, and that its lessening <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>spire, on
which his eyes were fixed in tearful contemplation, should one
day become the beacon towering amidst the gentle landscape to
guide the literary pilgrim of every nation to his
tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is no depreciation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius to say
that above his aspirations after fame, whatever they might be,
rose the aims and desires of Luther&mdash;a man absorbed in zeal
for the salvation of souls, and for the glory of his Saviour; but
it would have filled him with wonder, could he have foreseen the
place he was to occupy in the history of the world, and how the
double tower of the Stadt Kirche, in which he preached, would
become a beacon to guide tens of thousands from both hemispheres
to the Augustinian monastery, where he lived, and to the Schloss
Kirche, where he lies buried.</p>
<p>The Luther Commemoration in England was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Soon after I left Kensington an immense assembly gathered in
Exeter Hall, to take up points in Luther&rsquo;s character and
work.&nbsp; If I remember rightly, I dwelt on that occasion at
some length on his domestic life, often assailed by his
opponents, but held in admiration by Protestants all over the
world.&nbsp; In lectures and addresses, <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>delivered
at Norwich, Peterborough, Bedford, and elsewhere, I dwelt on his
manifold excellences and achievements, at Leipzig, at Worms, in
the Wartburg, and his Wittenberg home.&nbsp; My remarks accorded
with those I have now introduced.</p>
<p>After the close of my pastorate in Kensington, Ealing became
my home.&nbsp; The professorships at New College were
continued.&nbsp; Sundays were spent in preaching the
Gospel.&nbsp; Literary studies were pursued to a larger extent
than they had been when pastoral duty claimed chief
attention.</p>
<p>In 1876 I was grieved by the death of Lady Augusta Stanley,
for she manifested towards me kindness which could not fail to
inspire my warmest gratitude.&nbsp; I never knew any other person
who had so much dignity and sweetness of demeanour, one who, with
many-sided sympathy, could make her numerous guests feel how
sincere were her friendly demonstrations.&nbsp; It often
surprised me, as it did others, how she paid marked attention to
all her guests, however numerous they might be.&nbsp; Her tact
was admirable.&nbsp; Nobody could leave the Deanery with the idea
of having been neglected.</p>
<p>Her &ldquo;At Homes&rdquo; were extraordinarily popular, for
every one was sure of meeting with notabilities of Church and
State, literature and science.&nbsp; Her <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>husband was
in full sympathy with her in all these respects.</p>
<p>She was intimately acquainted with foreign celebrities, and
her conversation about them was of much interest.&nbsp; She and
her mother, Lady Elgin, spent some days in Lamartine&rsquo;s
house at Paris, when violent mobs, during the Revolution,
assembled in front of the residence.&nbsp; The President behaved
bravely, but expressed fear lest any insult should be offered to
English ladies under his roof.&nbsp; Mother and daughter, if I
remember right, had been offered refuge by the President when the
utmost peril filled the French capital.&nbsp; Lady Augusta
related interesting anecdotes of Lamartine; and I gathered that
he habitually indicated no small confidence in himself, feeling
that he was the greatest man in France, as no doubt, at the time,
he really was.</p>
<p>Her Ladyship and the Dean were well acquainted with M. Guizot,
and gave interesting accounts of that distinguished statesman,
and of his habits and studies after retirement from public
life.&nbsp; I happened once, when talking of Earl Russell, to
make the remark, that I had heard of his cold manner to political
acquaintances.&nbsp; Her countenance lighted up, and she spoke
with enthusiasm of what he was in the bosom of his family, and
the circle of intimate <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>friends.&nbsp; Bishop Thirlwall was
a great favourite with her, and she related interesting anecdotes
of that distinguished man, indicating a warm heart, in union with
a keen intellect.</p>
<p>Lady Augusta&rsquo;s visit to St. Petersburg with the Dean, at
the marriage of the Duke of Edinburgh, proved too much for her
strength, and at Paris in the following autumn serious illness
set in.&nbsp; From time to time amendment and relapse excited
hope and fear, until all prospect of recovery vanished.&nbsp; She
spoke of friends, sent kind messages, and talked calmly and with
humble confidence of the other world, saying, &ldquo;Think of me
as near, only in another room.&nbsp; &lsquo;In my Father&rsquo;s
house are many mansions.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; I had a touching
note from the Dean asking me to be a pall-bearer at the
funeral.&nbsp; All chosen for that office indicated causes,
classes, and places in which she felt an interest.&nbsp;
Religion, literature, and philanthropy, the neighbourhood in
which she lived, and Scotland&mdash;each had a
representative.</p>
<p>The assembly of mourners in the Jerusalem Chamber; the
spectacle in the Abbey; the procession up the nave whilst the
Queen occupied a little gallery not far from the western door;
the calm submission of the bereaved husband, as he sat by the
coffin; the solemn entrance into Henry VII.&rsquo;s <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Chapel; the
ray of sunlight falling on the coffin as it sank into the vault;
and especially the words, &ldquo;I heard a voice from
Heaven,&rdquo; sung by choristers invisible at the moment, as if
music came from the Upper Temple&mdash;these incidents can never
be forgotten.</p>
<p>It was by royal command that this lady, descended from the
royal Bruce, was buried in a chapel reserved for royal persons;
and immediately after the interment wreaths from the Queen and
her children were strewn over the grave.&nbsp; The three
benedictions&mdash;the Mosaic, the Pauline, and the
Ecclesiastical&mdash;which the deceased loved to hear were
pronounced, at the close of the service, by the Dean from a desk
in the nave.&nbsp; She had said to him, &ldquo;Think of me as you
repeat the holy words.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did, when she was gone as
when she was living.</p>
<p>The Dean sometimes referred to his visit to St. Petersburg in
company with her ladyship, and spoke of his having before him, as
he tied the nuptial knot on that memorable occasion, no less than
four princes, each of whom was expectant of a crown&mdash;the
Prince of Wales, the Crown Prince of Prussia, the Crown Prince of
the Netherlands, and the Czarevitch; and he also mentioned this
<a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>circumstance&mdash;that after the wedding party had
passed in state through a magnificent hall, where no provision
for a banquet could be seen, within an hour and a half they sat
down to a feast of sumptuous splendour, reminding him of
Belshazzar&rsquo;s, not in point of excess, but in point of regal
display.&nbsp; The fact was, the side-tables had been concealed
behind screens and drapery.&nbsp; The middle one had in that
space of time been fixed and adorned.</p>
<p>I may here mention that one day, during a visit to the
Deanery, I had much conversation with Miss Stanley, the
Dean&rsquo;s sister, an agreeable companion, who freely indulged
in some common recollections of dear old Norwich, and some
friends whom we had both known.&nbsp; She told me a great deal
about her good father, the Bishop, dwelling with admiration upon
his exceedingly simple habits, and his determination never to
give at the Palace <i>grand dinners</i>, but only such as
combined hospitality with Christian unostentation.</p>
<p>Two or three days previous to Lady Augusta&rsquo;s funeral, I
breakfasted at Lambeth, when Archbishop Tait, amongst other
things, spoke of his desire for some union with Protestant
Dissenters as far as it was possible; and this led to proceedings
which, as <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>they have not been reported in any fulness, may be
recorded here.</p>
<p>It was a delicate question who should first move in the
matter.&nbsp; The Archbishop wished to invite brethren to
Lambeth, but what reason was to be assigned for taking such a
step?&nbsp; At length it was arranged that some communication
should be made to him, indicative of a disposition on the part of
Nonconformists to confer with Episcopalian brethren.&nbsp; On
such a ground the Archbishop considered he might bring together
bishops, ready to join in a conference.&nbsp; I undertook to
prepare a letter and get it signed, so that Dr. Tait might feel
he had sure footing for what might follow.&nbsp; It was based on
a recognition of pleasure felt by Nonconformists, in consequence
of passages in his recent charges touching religious union.&nbsp;
The letter went on to express willingness to meet brethren for
consultation respecting co-operation in religious service so far
as it might be possible and wise.&nbsp; It was signed by
well-known ministers, and was acknowledged by the Archbishop
under the term of &ldquo;memorial,&rdquo; an expression which, if
I remember rightly, had not been employed by us.</p>
<p>Four Nonconformist ministers accordingly went down to Lambeth
to converse on the subject.&nbsp; <a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>Previous to this interview, it was
my conviction that to discuss the subject of <i>union</i> by
itself was by no means desirable, as it might raise questions
which would defeat the end in view.&nbsp; In harmony with this,
the following opinion was expressed by a friendly
prelate:&mdash;&ldquo;Such a neutral subject as the progress of
irreligious thought, would do well as a basis for a friendly
meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note received from the Archbishop before we met, he said,
&ldquo;I beg leave to assure you that all the bishops whom I have
consulted agree in the extreme importance of this movement, and
in an earnest desire that by proper preliminary arrangements your
proposal for a conference may be brought to a satisfactory
result.&rdquo;&nbsp; The proposal for a conference, I think, did
not <i>originate</i> with me, though I quite approved of it, and
was glad the Archbishop had kindly arranged for its being
held.</p>
<p>I subjoin the following record, received from Lambeth,
respecting a conference which the ministers named held with the
Archbishop beforehand:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May 24th, 1876: The Archbishop of
Canterbury saw the Rev. Dr. Stoughton, the Rev. Dr. Angus, the
Rev. Newman Hall, and the Rev. Dr. Aveling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentlemen present having heard from the Archbishop
what had passed with the bishops who <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>met at the Ecclesiastical
Commission, it was the opinion of those present that there was
ample room for united efforts to stem growing infidelity and
ungodliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; Therefore that a united conference as to the
best means of attempting to spread the knowledge of the answers
to materialistic and atheistic sophistries might be attended with
very beneficial results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; That such a conference might with great
advantage consider the lamentable ignorance and indifference as
to religion which prevails amongst masses of the community, and
the best modes of meeting these evils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; That such a conference might also with
advantage consider what efforts are needed to rouse the classes
above the artisan class to a greater appreciation of the
realities of religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; That it would be desirable that at such a
conference those present should come prepared to state their
experience as to the difficulties to be met, and the proposed
remedies.&nbsp; It was agreed that a day after the first week in
July would be suitable for such a conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result of this was reported by the Archbishop to an
informal meeting of certain bishops at the Room of the House of
Lords: present, the <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>Archbishop of York, the Bishops of
London, Winchester, St. Asaph, Llandaff, Gloucester and Bristol,
and Carlisle; and Monday, July 4th, at twelve noon, was fixed for
our gathering.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We assembled accordingly on July 4th, and there were present
besides the Primate, the Bishops of London, Winchester,
Peterborough, Gloucester, Bath and Wells, Drs. Allon, Raleigh,
Punshon, Rigg, Aveling, Angus, Cumming, Robertson of Edinburgh
(an old schoolmate of Dr. Tait); the Revs. J. C. Harrison, Newman
Hall, Josiah Viney, and several others whom I cannot call to mind
as, unfortunately, I have not kept a list.</p>
<p>The Archbishop presided, read the Scriptures, and offered
prayer.&nbsp; He opened the proceedings by an appropriate
address, and then requested me to give some account of the steps
which had led to our meeting together.&nbsp; I could not help
referring to some remarkable gatherings in the Jerusalem Chamber,
March 1640&ndash;1, convened by Dr. Williams, at that time Bishop
of Lincoln, and also Dean of Westminster, when several other
dignitaries met certain Presbyterian divines.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;was done by order of the
House of Lords, with a view to settling points of difference
between ecclesiastical parties of that day.&nbsp; A scheme of
comprehension <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>was contemplated.&nbsp; It came to nothing, though the
intercourse seems to have been pleasant, and they were hospitably
entertained by the convener.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This was the
last course of all public Episcopal treatments,&rdquo; said the
witty Thomas Fuller, who added: &ldquo;The guests may now soon
put up their knives, seeing, soon after, the voider was called
for, which took away all bishops&rsquo; lands.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
emphasised the fact that we had assembled for a very different
purpose, not to discuss any plan of comprehension, but to see how
parties, remaining ecclesiastically as we were, could,
notwithstanding, <i>unite</i> in defence of our common faith
against those who opposed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a common cause,&rdquo; it was added; &ldquo;and
let us aim at extending the influence of our common
Christianity&mdash;this would bring us into spiritual and
practical fellowship, the most enduring of all
bonds.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bishop of Bath and Wells followed and
spoke on the specific point&mdash;how we should meet doubts and
difficulties in reference to religion.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Peterborough discussed the subject generally, with great
eloquence and force.&nbsp; The Bishops of London and Winchester
made practical suggestions as to guarding Christians against
scepticism, and rousing people at large from <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>indifference and neglect.&nbsp; Drs. Rigg, Angus, and
others, combatted infidel objections and enforced attention to
the subject before us.&nbsp; A spirit of harmony pervaded the
meeting.</p>
<p>We broke up the morning conference at two o&rsquo;clock, and
then lunched together; reassembling at three o&rsquo;clock, when
the Bishop of Gloucester, Dr. Punshon, and several besides,
resumed the conversation.&nbsp; No representatives of the press
were present, and no report, that I am aware of, was taken and
preserved.&nbsp; We wished to prevent the controversial treatment
of what took place.&nbsp; Two of those who were there, together
with myself, received and complied with a request to prepare some
brief statement for <i>The Times</i>, on the character and
purpose of our meeting.&nbsp; Of course, the whole matter was
criticised afterwards, chiefly however in private.&nbsp; I do not
remember that it was taken up controversially in religious
periodicals.&nbsp; To correct some
misapprehensions&mdash;expressed in a Dissenting
newspaper&mdash;I, at the request of an esteemed brother, wrote a
short letter of explanation.</p>
<p>When we separated, gratification was expressed by those who
were present.&nbsp; Some Nonconformists did not enter into the
movement; others did, and that most heartily.&nbsp; From several
Episcopalian friends <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>we received assurances of approval
and sympathy.&nbsp; It issued in no united action; no fresh
organisation had, as far as I know, ever been intended.&nbsp; The
purpose designed was accomplished by interchanging thought,
collecting information, and encouraging one another in
ministerial work.</p>
<p>For Archbishop Tait I had great respect and affection.&nbsp;
He was singularly kind and conversable, without affecting any
official superiority.&nbsp; Under his grave countenance, and
habitually serious demeanour, as one who lived ever &ldquo;in his
Great Taskmaster&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; there were veins of
cheerfulness and humour in his familiar intercourse&mdash;I felt
deeply, his gentle sympathy, expressed in a letter of condolence,
on my dear wife&rsquo;s death; and the last time we talked
together, being interrupted by another person, he broke off in
the opening of what seemed an amusing tale.&nbsp; He appreciated
the relative position of Church and Dissent, better than any
other dignitary I have met with.&nbsp; He would say that
Nonconformists had their traditions, organisations, endowments,
and influence, which gave them a status they were not likely to
surrender by bringing over what belonged to them, into an
Episcopalian organisation.&nbsp; A fraternal <i>modus
vivendi</i>, he regarded as the object to be aimed at, not an
absorption of Dissenting bodies into <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the Establishment.&nbsp; He, no
doubt, would have preferred to see <i>One Great Church</i> in
England, under a moderate Episcopacy; but he seemed to cherish
little hope of any such object being accomplished.</p>
<p>On a former page allusion was made to Mr. Bagster, of Polyglot
fame.&nbsp; In the year (1877) his venerable wife, at the age of
100 <i>within a few hours</i>, died at Old Windsor; and her
accumulated years attracted the notice of Her Majesty, who
honoured her with a visit just before her decease.&nbsp; I called
at the cottage in which she expired, after the royal visitor had
been there, and there heard the particulars of the
interview.&nbsp; Her Majesty I was informed, brought with her the
Princess Beatrice; and, on their entrance into the bedroom, where
the old lady was lying, she at once expressed her gratitude for
the signal favour bestowed by her Sovereign, saying that
&ldquo;she was looking forward to her own speedy dismissal to the
immediate presence of the Saviour, where she hoped hereafter to
meet Her Majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pleasant conversation followed, in
which Mrs. B., at the Queen&rsquo;s request, related her memories
of George III., Queen Charlotte, and the Royal Family, as they
used to walk on the Castle terrace, in the presence of a large
number of loyal spectators.&nbsp; The Queen manifested interest
in <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>particulars respecting the good old lady, related by
her daughter; and in consequence of the report she gave on her
return home, Prince Leopold, as I was told soon afterwards, paid
a visit to Old Windsor, and wished for a rehearsal of what had
been communicated by his Royal Mother.&nbsp; Repeated gracious
inquiries from the Castle followed.&nbsp; At the funeral service
a note was put into my hands, written by the Duchess of Roxburgh
to Miss Bagster, tenderly touching on that lady&rsquo;s sorrow,
for her late bereavement; and concluding with the words:
&ldquo;The Queen begs you to convey to all the members of your
venerable mother&rsquo;s family, the assurance of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s condolence.&rdquo;&nbsp; This note was read to
the mourners.</p>
<p>In 1877 I made two pilgrimages which left memorable
impressions.&nbsp; All my life I have been an enthusiastic
shrine-seeker, loving to trace out spots sanctified by footsteps
of heroic and holy men.&nbsp; I heartily adopt the words of Dr.
Martineau, &ldquo;No material interests, no common welfare, can
so bind a community together, and make it strong of heart, as a
history of rights maintained and virtues uncorrupted and freedom
won; and one legend of conscience is worth more to a country than
hidden gold and fertile plains.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>At
different periods I have visited the birthplaces of Shakespeare
and of Raleigh, of Cromwell and of Wesley; the homes of Knox,
Hampden, Milton, Baxter, and Howard; the haunts of Johnson,
Goldsmith, Watts, and Cowper; the graves of Bunyan, Burns, Scott,
and Chalmers have all had attractions for me.</p>
<p>The pilgrimages I made in 1877 were the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>The first to the Vosges district in France, searching for Ban
de la Roche, the scene of Oberlin&rsquo;s labours, and the
resting place of his remains. <a name="citation268"></a><a
href="#footnote268" class="citation">[268]</a>&nbsp; From
Strassburg my daughter and I went to Mutzig, situated amidst a
theatre of red sandstone hills mantled with woods and
vineyards.&nbsp; Then from Mutzig we proceeded to Fouday, through
valley after valley, if not exactly picturesque, yet really
pictorial, and finally approached the parish of the model
pastor.&nbsp; In the heart of the village of Ban de la Roche, are
the church hallowed by his preaching, and the grave where he
sleeps.&nbsp; Three broad slabs lie on the green turf, side by <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>side, the
middle one inscribed with the words, &ldquo;Il fut 60 ans
p&egrave;re de ce canton.&mdash;&lsquo;La M&eacute;moire du juste
sera en benediction.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; An iron cross bears the
name &ldquo;Papa Oberlin.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were surprised to find
the spot, though highly situated, so rich in beauty as summer
waned; an afternoon sun warming the crisp air, and lighting up
objects with varied tints.&nbsp; At Walderbach, a Swiss-like
village, full of cottages and fruit trees, we found the parsonage
house in which the good man lived and died.&nbsp; We were
welcomed by the present clergyman&rsquo;s wife, whom we had met
before, without knowing her.&nbsp; The good lady took us over the
rooms associated with her husband&rsquo;s predecessor.&nbsp;
There was the study where he worked, and the bedroom in which he
slept.&nbsp; Some of his furniture is preserved, with a
collection of toys he made for children, and a large jar full of
still fragrant rose leaves, a few of which were gratefully
accepted as a memento of the visit.</p>
<p>The other pilgrimage was in England to Broad Oak, Shropshire,
where Philip Henry resided and where his son Matthew was
born.&nbsp; It stands where the Wrexham Road is intersected by a
lane leading to Whitwell Church.&nbsp; It is a small farmhouse,
part of a larger one, with heavy beams, and a broad <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>chimney
corner, like what one sees in Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s cottage near
Stratford-on-Avon.&nbsp; When in its primitive state, it must
have been spacious, for, says the famous Puritan, &ldquo;I have
room for twelve friends in my beds, a hundred in my barn, and a
thousand in my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he resembled
&ldquo;Abraham sitting at his tent door, in quest of
opportunities to do good.&nbsp; If he met with any poor near his
house, and gave them alms in money, he would, besides, bid them
go to his door for relief.&nbsp; He was very tender and
compassionate towards poor strangers, and travellers, though his
candour and charity were often imposed upon by cheats and
pretenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mention of Broad Oak occurs repeatedly in the Life of the
father, written by his affectionate son.&nbsp; The latter tells
of his father&rsquo;s removal to Broad Oak, and the providences
concerning him there, of &ldquo;the rebukes he lay under at Broad
Oak,&rdquo; and of the last nine years of his life, in
&ldquo;liberty and enlargement at Broad Oak.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a
time when ministerial engagements were by no means so numerous
and diversified as they are at present; when habits of home
study, quiet visitation of the flock, and catechising the
children, rather than preaching on public occasions, attending
large <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>meetings, and travelling to and fro along the length
and breadth of the land, distinguished both town and country
clergymen; when those who were connected with the Established
Church, and had no restraints put upon their activity, spent what
would be now considered very retired and monotonous lives; what
must have been the secluded and stationary position of an ejected
minister between the Restoration and the Revolution!&nbsp; No
wonder, then, that almost every incident and effort belonging to
Philip Henry&rsquo;s career belonged to the farm at Broad Oak,
where he lived and died, and wrote and suffered, and walked and
taught, bringing up his children, and receiving his friends, and
paying visits to his neighbours, under the shadow of the
umbrageous trees which gave a name to his pleasant homestead.</p>
<p>I drove over to the house, or rather that part of it which
still remains, a part of the kitchen, as I suppose, in which the
good man used to preach.&nbsp; The people of the house showed me
some relics&mdash;the pulpit cushion, and, I think, the pulpit
itself, or some portion of it; also some buttons which belonged
to Philip Henry&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<p>At Whitwell is a chapel containing Philip Henry&rsquo;s <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>monument,
which once stood in the parish edifice of Whitchurch.</p>
<p>At the end of the Whitwell epitaph are the words, &ldquo;In
dormitorium hic juxta positum demisit June 24, Anno Dom. MDCXCVI,
&AElig;tatis LXV.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was it in imitation of this, that
the words were introduced in Matthew Henry&rsquo;s monument in
Holy Trinity Church, Chester, &ldquo;Confectum corpus huic
dormitorio commisit 22 die Junii, 1714, Anno &aelig;tat
52&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Dr. Howson, Dean of Chester, who was staying with me at Crewe
Hall when this visit was arranged, intended to be my companion,
for he was a great admirer of the Henrys; but illness prevented
him.</p>
<p>In 1877 I was invited by Dr. Stanley to deliver a missionary
lecture in Westminster Abbey, one of a series he had arranged, in
which some friends of his, not clergymen in the Establishment,
took part.</p>
<p>In 1877 I gave a lecture in the room of the Society of Arts on
the prospects and perils of modern civilisation.&nbsp; One of the
audience was a native gentleman attached to the Chinese
Embassy&mdash;a very intelligent person, speaking English well,
and showing by his conversation how clearly he grasped points of
the address he had just <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>heard.&nbsp; It was a singular
circumstance that a representative of the largest empire of the
world&mdash;which not long ago counted all other nations as
barbarous&mdash;should listen to a barbarian as he represented
the good and <i>evil</i> of European civilisation.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas (1877) two or three days were spent at
the Deanery of Westminster, and on the Sunday afternoon Dr.
Stanley walked with me on the terrace of the Parliamentary
Houses, where we had some interesting talk.&nbsp; He pointed to
the palatial edifice at our back as we looked across the river,
and said, &ldquo;This is the palace of the nation&rdquo;; turning
attention to St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, he remarked, &ldquo;That
is the palace of the poor&rdquo;; and next, looking towards
Lambeth, he added, &ldquo;There is the palace of the
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; We discussed the state and prospects of the
Establishment, and he, as a staunch advocate for its continuance,
propounded schemes of reform, which, looking at the state of
parties, seemed to me quite impracticable.&nbsp; He was filled
with an idea of comprehension, if not within wide Episcopalian
limits, then by a State union of different
denominations&mdash;for example, thus: He would have been glad to
see a Presbyterian Moderator, a <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>Congregational Chairman, and a
Wesleyan President sitting in the House of Lords on a bench with
the bishops.&nbsp; He further thought that, as Charles II. was
willing to have Nonconformist chaplains, after the Restoration,
so an English sovereign might now, without any impropriety, do
the same; and if the Uniformity Act were modified so as to allow
a Dissenting minister to enter a pulpit of the Establishment,
there would be no legal bar in the way.&nbsp; My friend had the
widest sympathies possible, and union, with him, was a
passion.</p>
<p>In some respects I have a feeling like the Dean&rsquo;s, but I
hold theological and ecclesiastical principles such as he did not
adopt.&nbsp; One fundamental difference between us was that he
overlooked the exercise of Church <i>discipline</i>, to which I
attach great importance.&nbsp; The study of State organisations
has convinced me that the &ldquo;union of Church and State&rdquo;
creates insuperable barriers in the way of ecclesiastical
discipline.&nbsp; If the Church be linked to the State, so that a
subject of the State becomes thereby legally entitled to
membership and communion,&mdash;that forms a strong bar to a
faithful correction of moral misconduct and fundamental
disbeliefs.&nbsp; It was a great difficulty <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>under the
Commonwealth.&nbsp; The devoted and holy Thomas Wilson, Bishop of
Sodor and Man, found it so in carrying on his diocese.&nbsp; He
said in his famous &ldquo;Ecclesiastical Constitutions&rdquo;
that his desire was &ldquo;We may not stand charged with the
scandals which wicked men bring upon religion, when they are
admitted to, and reputed members of, Christ&rsquo;s Church; and
that we may, by all laudable means, promote the conversion of
sinners, and oblige men to submit to the discipline of the
Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; But for myself, let me say I have not found
any difficulty in the maintenance of discipline in Congregational
Churches.&nbsp; Whatever might be the basis of Dr.
Stanley&rsquo;s far-reaching comprehension, it appears to me
there might be a much broader range of religious sympathy and
co-operation between distinct religious bodies connected with the
maintenance of well-accentuated beliefs, and the exercise of
ecclesiastical discipline.</p>
<p>In the early part of the following year I visited Edinburgh to
lecture for the Philosophical Society of that city.&nbsp; My
subject was &ldquo;The Great Rebellion&rdquo;; and I made a
double attempt, first, to vindicate the Parliament policy as
against the despotic unconstitutionalism of the infatuated
monarch; and <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>secondly, to criticise the proceedings of some eminent
men on the Puritan and popular side.&nbsp; The society invited me
to lecture again, when different historical ground was taken, and
a sketch was presented of English and Scotch life in the days of
Queen Anne.</p>
<p>My old friend, and large-hearted host, the Rev. George D.
Cullen, favoured me with the company at dinner, of Dr. Goold,
Moderator of the Free Church; Dr. Hanna, son-in-law to Dr.
Chalmers; Dr. Alexander, and others&mdash;and we had earnest talk
about topics of the day.&nbsp; Scotch and English elements of
thought, blended so as to bring diversities into view, without
any portion of the acrimony common to polemical debate.&nbsp;
True blue Presbyterianism rose in contrast with milder colours of
Ecclesiasticism.&nbsp; There was no want of thrust or repartee,
but we kept the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.&nbsp;
Edinburgh society is of the choicest kind.&nbsp; Some of the best
talkers may be found on the other side the border; and memories
of celebrities in Auld Reekie, are amongst the most pleasant of
my life.&nbsp; On the occasion just noticed, my friend Mr. Cullen
took me over to St. Andrews; and there Principal Tulloch did the
honours of ciceroneship to perfection.&nbsp; In the evening we <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>dined at
the house of Professor Swann, where further social enjoyments of
a high university order were found to be in store.</p>
<p>During this visit to Scotland a curious fact was related to me
by the librarian of the University.&nbsp; Drummond of Hawthornden
bequeathed books to the library of that institution, and in the
catalogue appeared an item of &ldquo;MSS. respecting Mary Queen
of Scots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These MSS. were long missing, and inquiries about them were
made in vain.&nbsp; Not very long before my visit, the librarian
received a communication from some one who said he had, in his
possession, papers belonging to the University; and on receiving
a reply to his letter, he forwarded them.&nbsp; They turned out
to be the missing treasure.&nbsp; How came this about?&nbsp; As
well as I can remember it appeared that a librarian of the last
century put one day into his coat pocket these very MSS., and
took them home for examination.&nbsp; He suddenly died.&nbsp; His
clothes were sent to a relative, and amongst them, the coat
containing the documents now mentioned.&nbsp; For a century
afterwards they remained forgotten, and then came to light.&nbsp;
The possessor, finding they belonged to Edinburgh University,
wrote to the librarian as stated above, and restored them to
their <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>proper place.&nbsp; The recovered property was shown to
me.&nbsp; It included original papers published some time ago,
and others not previously known; but, if I may venture to say so,
after a brief inspection, they did not promise to be of so much
service as was hoped, in throwing fresh light on the mysteries of
poor Mary&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>The seventh General Conference of the Evangelical Alliance was
held in Basle, September 1st 1879.</p>
<p>There was a large gathering of delegates from Germany, France,
Austria, Italy, Spain, Holland, America and England.&nbsp; The
president was M. C. Sarasin, Councillor of State, who is said to
have descended from a Moorish ancestor settled in the
canton.&nbsp; He showed himself to be acquainted with English
literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me remind our English friends,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;of the words their great poet puts in the mouth of Richard
II.:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Look
not to the ground<br />
Ye favourites of a king!&nbsp; Are we not high?<br />
High be our thoughts.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let us cherish high thoughts, my friends!&nbsp; Are we
not the servants of a King, of the King of kings, and Lord of
lords?&nbsp; And is it not His work we are carrying on?</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&lsquo;Die sach&rsquo; ist dein, Herr Jesu Christ,<br
/>
Die sach&rsquo; an der wir stehen.&rsquo;<br />
(The cause is Thine, Lord Jesus Christ,<br />
The cause for which we stand.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus let our work be done, our testimony be given, our
efforts be united, in the same joyful steadfast spirit, with the
same buoyancy, with which the Apostle, with chained hands,
appealed to his flock at Philippi, &lsquo;Rejoice in the Lord
always, and again I say, rejoice.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were animating words, and awakened an enthusiastic
response, when uttered in the old church of St. Martin, where
&AElig;colampadius first preached the doctrines of the
Reformation.</p>
<p>I give the following <i>resum&eacute;</i> of some remarks I
made at the Basle Alliance meeting.</p>
<p><i>The Times</i> reported:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Stoughton contrasted the gathering of peoples in
that assembly, representative of all nations, with a meeting held
in Basle four hundred and fifty years ago.&nbsp; Christendom was
then in a very divided state, for the spirit of religious inquiry
was breaking out, and the great moot-point was, in all
theological controversy, &lsquo;Where lies the ultimate authority
for religious beliefs&mdash;in Popes, in Councils, or in the Word
of God?&rsquo;&nbsp; They met that day in times of a somewhat
different<a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>character, but of still deeper and wider agitation, for
the question now was, not only whether the Church or the Bible
was the final test of truth, but also whether reason or
revelation should be our guide as to the highest of all subjects
which could affect the present and future interests of the human
family.&nbsp; But how vast the difference between that famous
Council at Basle and the Evangelical Alliance Conference of this
day!&nbsp; Under what different aspects was union regarded by the
two assemblies!&nbsp; The one aimed at uniformity, at a precise
and definitely-expressed agreement of opinion, in relation to
theological and ecclesiastical points, which might be enforced on
all Christendom by pains and penalties,&mdash;even death, to a
recreant brother.&nbsp; The other seeks to promote unity,
holding, after the experience of ages, that uniformity was
impossible, and that true unity could not only be attained, but
was compatible with a hearty, loving, sympathetic Christian
fellowship throughout the family of the redeemed.&nbsp; He then
contrasted the appearance of the two meetings, traced out the
history of the followers of John Huss, and, in a long and
exceedingly able and interesting historical review of the history
of the Reformation, showed that Protestant England was not only
indebted to Basle for men <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>but for principles; and, identifying
the two with the work of Calvin at Geneva and John Knox in
Scotland, he contended that the outcome of those early struggles
was not only religious freedom in Europe, but, mainly through the
Puritans of England, the religious life and progress of
America.&nbsp; Their simple reliance now, as then, was the Gospel
of Christ, and freedom to preach and practise its heaven-born
truths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have a great delight in all genuine Christian union, but my
conception of it is by no means confined to the cultivation of
love and sympathy with those, who in all, or in most, respects
concur with me.&nbsp; There is an admirable passage in Julius
Hare&rsquo;s preface to the third volume of Arnold&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are so bound and shackled, by
all manner of prejudices, national, party, ecclesiastical,
individual, that we can hardly move a limb freely; and we are so
fenced and penned in, that few can look over their
neighbour&rsquo;s land, or up to any piece of sky, except to
<i>that which is just over their heads</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took
an active part in the early history of the Evangelical Alliance,
and I rejoice in those points of agreement which are expressed in
its Evangelical faith; but I have never liked its exclusion of
some good people from its fellowship, on the ground of
differences in relation <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>to ecclesiastical ordinances.&nbsp;
I would look kindly over &ldquo;my neighbour&rsquo;s land,&rdquo;
and towards &ldquo;pieces of sky&rdquo; which are not &ldquo;just
over my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can scarcely bring myself to speak of the sorrow which
befell me in November 1879.&nbsp; My beloved wife then died, and
was interred in Hanwell Cemetery, which pertains to the parish of
Kensington.&nbsp; The beautiful words in Proverbs are inscribed
on her gravestone: &ldquo;Her children arise up, and call her
blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
time ago I read in the Life of my American friend, Dr. Hodge, the
following passage respecting the deceased companion of <i>his</i>
life.&nbsp; I can truly appropriate it to my departed loved
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;A humble worshipper of Christ, she lived in
love and died in faith.&nbsp; Trustful woman, delightful
companion, ardent friend, devoted wife, self-sacrificing mother,
we lay you gently here, our best beloved, to gather strength and
beauty for the coming of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dearest friend Joshua Harrison, who was to her as a
brother, preached a funeral sermon, in which he said, &ldquo;The
strength of her life was her faith in the Son of God.&nbsp; Her
path, though the sun shone brightly upon it, was often a thorny
one.&nbsp; Her own health was liable to frequent interruptions,
and her <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>heart was pierced again and again by the loss of
children, whom she loved better than herself.&nbsp; Oh, the
unmurmuring resignation with which seven several times, she saw
her dear ones carried to the grave!&nbsp; Oh, the courage with
which she bore the shock!&nbsp; She never wavered in the
conviction, &lsquo;He loved me and gave Himself for me,&rsquo;
but felt that these sad sorrows must be only the obscurer
manifestations of His love.&nbsp; And hence she could write,
&lsquo;Here we shall never be exempt from trial and sorrow, but
when we reach that changeless home above, there will be no need
of sanctifying us there.&nbsp; All that is needful to make us
meet for that holy place must be done here; and oh, how much
pruning and purging, how much of grace and strength we need to
help us to walk more closely with Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has reached that changeless abode now, and has left
all sorrow behind.&nbsp; Long, long had she been waiting, but the
message came so suddenly at last, that, without knowing she was
dying, she found herself at home.&nbsp; The words discovered in
her desk, which by copying she had made her own, received sweet
and exact fulfilment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The way is long, my Father, and my soul<br
/>
Longs for the rest and quiet of the goal;<br />
<a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>While
yet I journey through this weary land,<br />
Keep me from wandering; Father, take my hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly and straight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead to Heaven&rsquo;s gate<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thy child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The way is long, my child, but it shall be<br />
Not one step longer than is best for thee,<br />
And thou shalt know, at last, when thou shalt stand<br />
Close by the gate, how I did take thy hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And quick and straight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead to Heaven&rsquo;s gate<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My child.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

285</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
1879&ndash;1883</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Need</span> was felt for some change after
my sad bereavement; so in March, 1880, my daughter and I started
for Italy.&nbsp; We tarried on our way a week at Cannes with my
friend, Mr. Prust, of Northampton, an old fellow-student, who had
a villa in the Riviera.&nbsp; I greatly enjoyed the climate and
scenery, and felt soothed by walks and drives on the shores,
through the cork groves, and round about to more distant places
of interest.&nbsp; Old affections sprang up anew between my
friend and myself as we talked of auld lang syne.&nbsp; Nothing
could exceed the kindness shown by him and his two interesting
nieces.</p>
<p>I met with some old acquaintances at Mentone; amongst the
rest, with a gentleman well known in the political and religious
world and closely connected with Lord Palmerston.&nbsp; He gave
me much <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>information as to what he apprehended was the state of
thought and feeling amongst the upper class in reference to
Christianity.&nbsp; There seemed to be a large amount of
light-hearted, thoughtless scepticism on the part of young
people; girls catching from their brothers doubts as to God and
Christ and eternity&mdash;doubts circulated in conversation and
in periodicals.&nbsp; The facts indicated did not strike me as
deep and earnest, but as froth on the surface of common talk;
not, however, to be passed over as a trifling phenomenon, for if
those who occupy superior stations in the world have their faith
shaken as to natural and revealed religion, it forebodes mischief
to wider circles round them.&nbsp; My informant was inclined to
believe that outspoken doubt and disbelief was less to be dreaded
than concealed enmity.&nbsp; Moreover, that whilst there was much
to excite concern in literature and social intercourse of the
present day, there was also an increase in the higher as well as
lower walks of thorough-going Christian experience and
practice.&nbsp; In my own limited acquaintance I have been
cheered to find instances of what appeared genuine piety where I
little expected them; works of benevolence going on nowadays
amongst all classes are surely tokens for good, which ought to
fill us with thankfulness.&nbsp; We are all tempted to <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>confine
ourselves to one side of the world and Church picture before us;
but we shall not get at the whole truth by shutting one eye and
keeping the other wide open.</p>
<p>Leaving Cannes, we travelled by the Cornice Railway to Genoa,
and there renewed acquaintance with churches, palaces, and
picture galleries, seen years before.&nbsp; Then tarrying at
Spezzia, we saw some new specimens of Italian scenery and
life.&nbsp; Pisa and Florence were again visited, cities in which
I loved to linger; and at the end of about ten days we reached
Rome.</p>
<p>I had an introduction to Cardinal Howard, who sent me an
invitation to visit him.&nbsp; I was met by a Monseignor friend
of his, with whom I had a good deal of conversation.&nbsp; We
discussed several topics, and then touched upon the relations in
which Catholics and Protestants stood to one another.&nbsp; He
considered there was improvement in this respect, more social
intercourse existing between them than was once the case.</p>
<p>Pio Nono had a Jewish friend, who became a convert.&nbsp;
Seeing him one day depressed, &ldquo;the holy father,&rdquo; as
this Monseignor called him, asked what was the cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just lost my father, who died a Jew, and <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>I am
greatly concerned about the state of his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was he a good Jew, devout and acting up to the
light he had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Then came the Pope&rsquo;s rejoinder, &ldquo;I will pray for
him; and do you pray for him, and I doubt not that God will have
mercy on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were his words as well as I can remember.&nbsp; The
drift of the story and its application were intended to show that
the deceased pontiff did not despair of a Jew&rsquo;s
salvation.&nbsp; He did not look upon those outside the Roman
pale as beyond the reach of God&rsquo;s mercy, though needing
purification in a future state.</p>
<p>Whilst we were talking the Cardinal came in.&nbsp; The
reception he gave me was singularly cordial, and we had a good
deal of friendly chat relative to the Stanley family.&nbsp; The
favours I asked he granted at once; one was a special
introduction to the chief librarian at the Vatican, and the
seeing more of its treasures than I had done when I visited the
library many years before.&nbsp; He took me into his library,
well furnished with books, in handsome bindings, and we had some
talk about Thomas Aquinas, in whose writings I took an
interest.&nbsp; He <a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>recommended to me some little books of analysis and
comment.&nbsp; He also procured a papal permission for my
daughter to see St. Peter&rsquo;s Crypt, which is closed to
ladies generally, on all days of the year except one.&nbsp; The
Cardinal arranged with one of the Vatican librarians that I
should have special facilities for seeing historical documents;
and afterwards, on my reaching the Vatican by appointment, I was
received by an officer, who accompanied me into one of the
magnificent galleries, which I had seen years before, to find
then all book-cases closed.&nbsp; Now some of them were opened,
and I was permitted to take down any volumes I liked; and I at
once luxuriated in the inspection of charming Aldine editions of
patristic and other authors&mdash;the paper as white, and the
printing as fresh, as when they were produced four centuries
ago.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that provision was made for the use of
printed books, and certain MSS., by readers, admitted after the
fashion in our British Museum.&nbsp; There are catalogues, giving
titles and press-marks; and, by writing for what you want upon
slips of paper, and handing them to an attendant, as in the
British Museum, you attain the volumes desired, which you can use
at desks provided for the purpose.&nbsp; A catalogue of much
greater <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>compass than exists at present, I was informed, is in
progress; but the Cardinal told me, it might be a long time
before it was finished, adding, that Rome is the Eternal City in
more senses than one.&nbsp; He encouraged me to believe that even
the archives of the Holy See might be accessible; but, far short
of that, MSS. which I wrote for, and examined, were sufficient to
convince me that there is abundant materials for extensive
research, beyond what was formerly possible.&nbsp; Besides, in
the vast Library of the Dominicans&mdash;who once had their
monastery at Sopra Minerva&mdash;a library which is now open to
the public, under certain regulations, there are the archives of
the Roman Inquisition; the historical use which now can be made
of them, appears in many numbers of <i>La Rivista Christiana</i>,
in which I found many valuable extracts.&nbsp; Much interesting
information respecting early Italian confessors may be found in
those Inquisitionary records.</p>
<p>I saw several Protestant brethren in Rome; and, besides
preaching in the Presbyterian Church twice, was invited to
address a large meeting of Italians, through the medium of the
Rev. Mr. Piggott, who was my kind interpreter.&nbsp; I took
occasion to lament that Italian Protestants, whilst not by any
means <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>numerous, were broken up into so many parties; said
that it would be far better if they would work together; and if
that were impossible, it was at least desirable and easy, not to
interfere with each other&rsquo;s proceedings, by opposition or
uncivil criticism.&nbsp; Judging from a response on the part of
an Italian, I was glad to find my remarks were not deemed
offensive; but I am afraid they did no real good.</p>
<p>Whilst in Rome at this time I tried to turn my visit to some
account by restudying its Christian antiquities.&nbsp; Christian
art in its early state is a subject illustrated by the
Catacombs.&nbsp; The rude paintings and sculptures familiar to
every Roman visitor, familiar by means of books to thousands who
have never seen the originals, are historical and symbolic.&nbsp;
Noah and the Ark, Abraham offering up Isaac, Moses receiving the
law, Jonah and the whale, Daniel and the lions, the three Hebrews
in the furnace&mdash;these have a Christian meaning, and point
typically to truths respecting Christ&rsquo;s redemption.&nbsp;
Subterranean Rome, it has been well said by a French author, is
&ldquo;<i>a living book</i>, palpable, everlasting,&rdquo; and
there are written on its pages, in hieroglyphic ways, truths
which are held by all true Christians, whether Protestant or
Catholic.&nbsp; The Agape or love-feast, a ship emblematic of the
Church, <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>the cross, the fish, the dove, and other well-known
signs of Christ and His salvation, occur over and over
again.&nbsp; Also there are historical pictures of the Nativity,
and of Peter denying his Master.&nbsp; Portraits also are found
of Christ, of Peter, of Paul.&nbsp; The Virgin Mary is seen by
the side of her husband, whilst the Holy Child, like an Italian
bambino, lies in His cradle, an ox licking His feet; close by,
the Magi are watching stars in the east.&nbsp; No picture or
image of the Virgin, in solitary magnificence, at all resembling
the Madonnas of a later period, so far as I can make out, has
been discovered in the Catacombs.&nbsp; The contrast between the
early attempts and the later achievements of Roman Christian art
in doctrinal significance, as well as in imaginative conception
and technical skill, is obvious and striking.&nbsp; To pass from
the former to the latter requires an immense stride; to go from
examining early representations of gospel facts and principles,
to look round churches and galleries rich in the works of modern
Catholic artists, is to exchange worlds.&nbsp; The difference in
religious meaning is as great as the difference in artistic
merit.</p>
<p>During this visit to Rome some remarkable religious meetings
were conducted by Dr. A. N. Somerville, of Glasgow, who in other
parts of Italy <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>the same spring, held revivalistic Protestant
services.&nbsp; Those at Rome occurred on a spot, to reach which
many citizens had to cross a bridge with a toll bar on it.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding, on the evening when we attended, I should think
about eight hundred people were present.&nbsp; The preacher could
not speak Italian, and what he said was translated into that
language, by a native Protestant.&nbsp; Everything was skilfully
managed, and the effect appeared on the whole, solemn and
impressive.&nbsp; Congregations after the same methods had been
previously gathered in Florence, where the addresses, according
to report, had produced considerable impression.&nbsp;
Sankey&rsquo;s hymns, translated into Italian, were sung at Rome,
with Sankey&rsquo;s tunes; how far solid evangelical results
followed I could not ascertain.</p>
<p>We made, at this time, two excursions which I must
notice.&nbsp; One was very short: only as far as Ostia, where
there are still some Roman remains.&nbsp; The present town is not
worth notice, but the ancient city, Hare says in his &ldquo;Days
near Rome,&rdquo; is like Pompeii.&nbsp; I cannot quite agree
with him.&nbsp; The deep ruts of Roman chariot wheels; fragments
here and there of Roman pottery, human bones, coloured marbles,
and a few architectural relics, are of interest; but what <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>attracted
me to the spot was the memory of Augustine, who, in his
&ldquo;Confessions,&rdquo; paints such a touching picture of his
mother Monica&rsquo;s illness and death.&nbsp; Thoughts of that
interview, as related by the converted son, were the only charm
of our visit, and the hour or two we were compelled to spend in
the place, for the refreshment of our coachman and his horse,
were most dreary.&nbsp; The long, long gossip going on between a
priest and the mistress of the little farm, betokened the intense
idleness and vulgarity of both,&mdash;typical, I fear, of the
whole neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Another expedition we made was of a very different kind.&nbsp;
We engaged a carriage to the charming haunts of Tivoli, where
picturesque objects in the town and its vicinity, and the
stupendous waterfall with manifold associations, clustering round
the immediate neighbourhood, created memorable delight.&nbsp;
Next day we drove to Subiaco, along an interesting road rich in
memories of old Roman rural life.&nbsp; My daughter wrote in her
journal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was a glorious morning, the sun was
shining brightly, and in the cool spring air, our three pretty
little black horses dashed along the road at a good pace, so that
we soon found ourselves <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>winding in and out amongst the
Sabine Hills.&nbsp; We climbed up a steep ascent, only to go
dashing down on the other side.&nbsp; The retreating hills,
rising here and there to a great height, were clothed with trees,
some of a sombre colour, some fresh with the bright hue of early
spring, with here and there a cluster of silver olives, making a
delightful variety of colour; whilst, at our feet, the roadside
was beautiful with anemones, cyclamen, honeysuckle, and
saxifrage; and, lower still, ran the refreshing river
Arno.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not far from Subiaco there is a deep gorge with sloping sides
of rock and foliage, reaching down to the river Arno, bordered by
chestnut trees, amidst which, here and there, rises a tall
cypress.&nbsp; The brow of the hill on the side nearest Subiaco,
is crowned by a far-famed monastery in which, very different from
what it is now, the great St. Benedict, founder of a monastery
which bears his name, spent his early days and prepared for his
great life work, which began at Monte Cassino, on the road from
Rome to Naples.</p>
<p>We left Subiaco for Olevano, and were benighted on our way, as
the horses toiled up hill after hill.&nbsp; We reached Olevano
late at night, and caused quite a commotion in the narrow street,
by our <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>inquiries after the hotel, where we were to pass the
night, and which, ignorantly, we had passed by, at the hill-top
which overlooks the town.&nbsp; There, to our delight, we met
with a most enjoyable reception, as the house is a favourite
resort for artists; and though we blundered into a room, already
occupied by guests, we were permitted to remain, and listen to
charming stories of the place and its surroundings.&nbsp; After
tarrying a few hours next morning, we had to hasten our
departure, that we might catch a train on the railway from Naples
to Rome.</p>
<p>After leaving Rome on our way to England, we halted some days
at Venice, and revived old recollections.&nbsp; I went over
points of interest in a visit years before, and new pictorial and
architectural pleasures were enjoyed.&nbsp; We proceeded to
Bologna, and crossed the beautiful Lago di Garda, spent a day or
two at Trent, where special services were being held for young
people, and hosts of &ldquo;shining ones&rdquo; in white, crowded
the churches.</p>
<p>In 1881 I visited Italy again, especially for the purpose of
carrying on researches commenced just before.&nbsp; The journey
was rapid.&nbsp; Reaching Turin, accompanied by my dear daughter,
I began my work by searching out localities which I could <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>easily
identify.&nbsp; In other places I picked up illustrations I
desired; for, when the mind is bent on a particular inquiry, it
is wonderful how it draws cognate matters to itself.&nbsp; We
made an excursion to Pavia, and, on the way, stopped at the
beautiful monastery of Certosa.&nbsp; Pavia, situated on the
river Ticino, with a covered bridge, is interesting, from its
antiquities and history.&nbsp; The churches are specimens of
Lombardic architecture, and in the Duomo one was startled to find
the tomb of Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, whose remains were
transferred from Africa to this city.&nbsp; They were there at
the time of our visit, his monument being full of magnificence
and beauty, in general form and particular details.&nbsp; Since I
was at Pavia, the body has been restored to its original
resting-place.&nbsp; Pavia connects itself with the philosopher,
Boetius, by a popular tradition that he was imprisoned in a tower
belonging to the city.&nbsp; Piacenza and Bologna during this
journey afforded gleanings which helped me to realise important
events occurring there at the time of the Reformation; but it was
in Florence that I did most work, and spent more than a week from
day to day tracking Savonarola&rsquo;s footsteps through the
streets, from San Marco to the Palazzo Vecchio, and back again,
not forgetting his visit <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>to Lorenzo di Medici at his villa in
Careggi, with views of rich woodlands and grassy fields.&nbsp;
But my chief employment was in the public library, searching out
and deciphering original documents, connected with his
trial.&nbsp; According to one account Savonarola underwent an
examination, first by words, then by threats, then by torture;
and on the second day of his imprisonment was put on the
rack.&nbsp; The account of the trial which I gathered from
original sources, was in harmony with that of Villari in his life
of the martyr.&nbsp; There are two letters appended, one
addressed to the Pope respecting <i>la vita buono</i> of the
sufferer, and another by a large number of Florentine
citizens.&nbsp; I was especially interested in Savonarola&rsquo;s
Bible, which he used to carry under his arm.&nbsp; It is entitled
&ldquo;Biblia integra,&rdquo; the type beautifully clear, the
date 1491.&nbsp; It contains some of his prophecies in MS.&nbsp;
Signor Guicciardini has contributed a large collection of
Savonarola&rsquo;s works to this Magliabecchian Library, as it is
called, and the catalogue of them runs over sixty pages.</p>
<p>After leaving Florence, we visited the Waldensian valleys, of
which I have given some account in my &ldquo;Footprints of
Italian Reformers,&rdquo; and I may here add, that I agree fully
with Professor Comba <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>in his opinion, that the Waldenses,
properly speaking, do not appear in history earlier than the
twelfth century, and then they are seen scattered over the South
of France at Metz, and in the Netherlands&mdash;their origin
being ascribed by their enemies to Peter Waldo of Lyons, who does
not appear to have visited the valleys.&nbsp; I found the good
people in the valleys opposed to the results of Professor
Comba&rsquo;s researches.&nbsp; An intelligent daughter of a
Waldensian minister said, &ldquo;We do not believe in them at all
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; After studying the subject, let me add, I
do.</p>
<p>In 1881 my dear friend Dr. Stanley died, after so short an
illness that I had no opportunity of seeing him in his last
hours.&nbsp; His funeral was an event of national interest.</p>
<p>He had much of the mind which distinguished &ldquo;that
disciple whom Jesus loved.&rdquo;&nbsp; His singular sweetness of
disposition was partly natural, for he was a gentle, quiet boy,
winning many hearts; but it was gracious and spiritual also, a
result of sincere discipleship to the Divine Master.&nbsp; I
often felt surprised at his extraordinary amount of forbearance
under most unjust and cruel attacks.&nbsp; I once alluded to the
need of patience amidst such trials, instancing Archbishop
Tillotson, who <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>left behind him a bundle of scurrilous letters,
labelled with the words, &ldquo;May God forgive the writers as I
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; I learned from my friend that once he was
accused of infidelity by an anonymous correspondent; and on
another occasion, after the figures of Moses, David, Paul, and
Peter had been placed in the choir of the Abbey, he received a
note beginning with a charge of idolatry.&nbsp; Our Broad Church
Dean, and the prelate of the Revolution were ecclesiastically and
socially much alike.&nbsp; As to theology the former told me
there is much in the teaching of Scripture which transcends human
conception, much which, running along lines of mystery, he felt
himself unable to follow; but, at the same time, he would remark,
there is much more that is plain, which &ldquo;a wayfaring man,
though a fool,&rdquo; may receive and &ldquo;not err
therein.&rdquo;&nbsp; To these plain things, he said, he desired
to cleave; these plain things he endeavoured to preach.&nbsp; The
main difference between others and himself was that certain
Evangelical principles were plainer to them than to him.</p>
<p>His interest in Bible study was intense, especially with
regard to historical and biographical subjects; and it was well
said, that whilst some critics seemed to delight in destroying
certain parts, <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>his delight was to build them up into a grand
whole.&nbsp; His habit was to maintain truth, so far as he saw
it, rather than to attack and overthrow error; and his gift of
felicitously adapting events and passages of Holy Writ to passing
incidents and characters, was truly wonderful; especially when an
opportunity occurred for weaving sacred associations round the
walls of his beloved Abbey.&nbsp; Nor did he fail to turn his
skill in this respect to admirable account, when preaching in
America.</p>
<p>Dr. Stanley&rsquo;s amiableness never betrayed a suspicion of
weakness in his character.&nbsp; Indeed he had a side almost
stern in some of its appearances; and he fought against what he
deemed evil, with great vehemence; and stood up very boldly, I
know, against unprincipled people, declaring that he would not
meet them, except in the presence of witnesses.</p>
<p>To see him at his best was to be with him alone, when he gave
full sway to his thoughts and feelings, expressing them with
greater freedom than I ever heard him do in company.&nbsp; The
most enjoyable time was late in the evening, after guests had
retired; especially when he conducted me to my bedroom,
candlestick in hand, and tarried for a good while chatting about
subjects and persons of interest to us both.</p>
<p><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Not
long before his death, I spent a night at Westminster, when we
talked about Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; With much pathos he read
aloud Carlyle&rsquo;s description of the Lord Protector&rsquo;s
last hours; and, some time before this, he told me that he had
been engaged in endeavouring to ascertain what became of the
hero&rsquo;s remains after indignities done to them at the
Restoration.</p>
<p>Soon after the Dean&rsquo;s death, I received from Mrs.
Drummond, his executrix, a note accompanied by the picture it
referred to.&nbsp; &ldquo;In a memorandum left by our dear Dean,
he desired a photograph of him, which used to stand in the
drawing-room, should be sent to you, in remembrance of a sincere
friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the composition of historical works he was in
the habit of employing such information as he could gather from
friends.</p>
<p>Oxford men have told me, that he used to lay under
contribution whatever he could learn from other people&rsquo;s
researches.&nbsp; For these, however, he was always ready to make
ample returns.</p>
<p>Dr. Stanley told me that he was in the habit of looking at
some historical characters through the medium of living people,
who appeared to him, in one way or other, to resemble them.&nbsp;
Excellencies and frailties <a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>on the part of deceased individuals,
thus came out more vividly before him.&nbsp; It struck me as a
considerable help to a realisation of what departed persons
<i>might</i> be; but it requires to be carefully employed, lest
from resemblances which are real, we infer other things which are
imaginary.</p>
<p>His taste was comprehensive.&nbsp; He loved everything which
related to English history, especially where it touched his own
dear Abbey.&nbsp; Conformity and Nonconformity he sometimes
sought to harmonise in surprising ways.</p>
<p>I may add here that there was in the Abbey a monument to Dr.
Watts in a dilapidated condition, when I suggested a plan for its
restoration.&nbsp; The plan was adopted, and in consequence the
monument was for a time removed.&nbsp; During its absence I
received a note containing a playful allusion to the
circumstance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If some strong Nonconformist should wander
through the Abbey this week, he may go away with the impression
that in a fit of sudden intolerance the Dean had torn down the
monument of Isaac Watts.&nbsp; I assure you that the gaping and
vacant chasm in the wall might well suggest such an
interpretation.&nbsp; I hope, however, in a few days the restored
angel and the mended harp of your sweet psalmist will <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>dispel any
hopes that may be awakened in High Churchmen or suspicions in
Nonconformists.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was informed not long after the Dean&rsquo;s death, that a
gentleman in Kent had in his possession what was said to be
Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s skull.&nbsp; A friend of mine procured
from that gentleman an invitation to see the relic.&nbsp; A
large, handsome box was placed on a table, and out of it was
taken, wrapped up in silk, a man&rsquo;s skull.&nbsp; The lower
part of the face was gone, leaving the upper jawbone entire, or
nearly so; and within the mouth we saw the shrivelled remains of
a tongue, while some of the skin on the upper part of the face
was still preserved.&nbsp; What astonished me was the quantity of
hair adhering to the scalp; and also the following circumstances
pertaining to the relic.&nbsp; The inside, carefully examined by
a medical companion, plainly appeared to have been embalmed;
signs of this were attached to the surface.&nbsp; Moreover, part
of a spike penetrated the upper bone, showing that once the skull
must have been exposed in a way common enough, when men, put to
death for political crimes, had their heads set up in conspicuous
places.&nbsp; Finally the head had been severed from the body,
not by a sharp axe, but by a knife which had hacked and torn the
skin.&nbsp; These peculiarities pointed to one who, having
received honourable burial, was afterwards <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>beheaded
with a blunt instrument, and then treated as a traitor, by having
his head exhibited like those fixed on the top of Temple
Bar.&nbsp; These peculiarities pertained to Oliver Cromwell; and
to no one else.&nbsp; Documents are preserved together with the
relic.&nbsp; They state that the relic remained publicly exposed
for a long time, till one night a gale of wind blew it down; that
a soldier on sentry picked it up and took it home, and then
became alarmed at finding there was search made after it by
public authorities.&nbsp; He concealed it down to the time of his
death; and when danger was over, the secret was divulged.&nbsp;
The skull was afterwards exhibited as a source of profit, and an
account of the exhibition appears among papers preserved in the
box.&nbsp; After being withdrawn from public view, it was
privately sold to an ancestor of the gentleman possessing it at
the time of my visit.&nbsp; There is a story afloat, that
Cromwell was not buried in Westminster, another corpse being
substituted for public interment, and, therefore, that the body
hanged at Tyburn was not his!&nbsp; This story is not to be
trusted.</p>
<p>In the August following Dean Stanley&rsquo;s death, I made,
with my friend Harrison and some of my family, a tour in
Germany.&nbsp; We were delighted with the Bavarian Highlands and
the Bader See.</p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>We
visited Oberammergau, and heard much about the Passion Play, and
were conducted to the place of performance, by persons who had
taken part in it.&nbsp; They gave us interesting
information.&nbsp; The priest of the place is no bigot.&nbsp; He
insisted that a Protestant, who had died in the village, should
be interred in consecrated ground, for which, we are told, he
received a rebuke from Rome.&nbsp; The drive we had from
Partenkirchen to Mittenwald called forth exclamations of great
delight.</p>
<p>In the following winter I mixed with members of various
denominations, some widely separated from others.&nbsp; This led
me to think a good deal about consistency.&nbsp; I noted down at
the time considerations of this kind.&nbsp; Everybody admits the
palpable truism, &ldquo;Truth is true, and falsehood is
false,&rdquo; and some deduce from that the corollary:
&ldquo;Then stick to the true, and eschew the false
altogether.&nbsp; Countenance what you believe, by consorting
exclusively with such as believe as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, it must be remembered, systems are complex, and cannot be
fairly dealt with in the fashion recommended by some.&nbsp; In
many cases, what is condemned as a whole, contains seeds of
another sort.&nbsp; There are estimable people who are not
accustomed to analyse what they condemn, and cannot see what of
truth <a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>may be found in the midst of error.&nbsp; To look alone
at one side of a system, which, after all, has much of truth, may
involve us in error.&nbsp; Thinking of Divine sovereignty, if not
connected with human responsibility, may land us in
Antinomianism; to dwell upon responsibility by itself, may make
us Pelagians.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1882, I went down to Rodborough, in
Gloucestershire, to visit my friend, Sir S. Marling, just made
baronet, and to preach, I think, for the seventh time, on behalf
of the Sunday Schools.&nbsp; The Countess of Huntingdon, George
Whitefield, and Rowland Hill had all been in some way connected
with the chapel.</p>
<p>On the occasion now mentioned, there was a large gathering of
day and Sunday scholars, a picture worthy of Wilkie&rsquo;s
pencil.&nbsp; Sir Samuel and his lady were encircled by guests
old and young, receiving from them demonstrations of affection in
loud huzzas.</p>
<p>Soon after my return from Italy I attended meetings connected
with Wesleyan Methodism, when my friend Mr. McArthur, (afterwards
knighted), was Lord Mayor of London.&nbsp; He invited me at
different times to meet a large number of ministers of his own
and other communions, and at such times he manifested the
catholic spirit by which he was eminently distinguished.&nbsp; I
think it was once in his <a name="page308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>mayoralty that the archbishops and
bishops dined at the Mansion House table, when toasts were
proposed, to which the Archbishop of Canterbury had to
respond.&nbsp; Afterwards Nonconformists were honoured in the
common way, and it fell to my lot to reply in a few words.&nbsp;
The Archbishop had, in a good-natured style, referred to the
cares and troubles of his right reverend brethren, and
himself.&nbsp; Alluding to what he had said, I ventured to remark
I was quite content with my humbler position, and had no
aspirations after a seat on the Episcopal Bench.&nbsp; Further, I
pleaded, as I always do, for catholic union, and remarked that I
strove to be a Christian first; next, a patriotic religious
Englishman; and thirdly, a devout Dissenter, adding that I should
be ashamed of my Nonconformity, if that were so obstreperous, as
to quarrel with the subordinate place I assigned to it.</p>
<p>At the close of the year 1882 Dr. Tait, Archbishop of
Canterbury, died.&nbsp; With him I had the pleasure of being
acquainted soon after his appointment to the See of London.&nbsp;
Our relations afterwards were very friendly.&nbsp; I was kindly
invited to share in the pleasure of his Lambeth hospitality; and
at a time of deep domestic sorrow he was one of the very first to
express affectionate <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>sympathy in a letter of
condolence.&nbsp; I found him always very kind, and he impressed
me with the conviction that in his judgment of Conformity and
Nonconformity, and of the relative duties of Churchmen and
Dissenters, he took much more sensible views than most of his
brethren.&nbsp; He did not seem to anticipate, as at all
probable, the comprehension of all, or most, English Christians
within the pale of one community; since each denomination has its
principles, its traditions, and its trust property, and is not
likely to merge its peculiarities in the adoption of
others.&nbsp; A wise, liberal, Christian <i>modus vivendi</i> was
the object of his desire.&nbsp; I attended his funeral, and met
in his residence at Addiscombe, a large number of clergymen, and
men of different opinions, drawn together by a common regard for
his eminent moral and religious worth.&nbsp; The trees were bare,
the ground was covered with snow, and the long procession walked
through the park, the winter sun brightening the scene.&nbsp; The
whole struck me as very solemn, and in harmony with the occasion
that had brought us together.</p>
<p>My journeys abroad were approaching an end when in 1882 my
daughter and I spent a few weeks in Switzerland, on the shores of
the Genevan lake, and in its neighbourhood.&nbsp; One <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>memorable
expedition we made was to Grenoble and the Grande
Chartreuse.&nbsp; The monastery was difficult of access early in
this century, but now there are well-appointed vehicles for
conveying tourists from the railway to the gates of this romantic
retreat.&nbsp; The ascent as far as Laurent du Pont is up a road
lined with acacias, bordering barley fields, commanding glimpses
of a magnificent valley, with bosky dells, cut in twain by the
river Isere.&nbsp; The gorge to the right increases in grandeur
as one ascends.&nbsp; Purple rocks rise from depths of massy
verdure, sublimity succeeds beauty, and, after reaching a broad
mountain-girdled plain, one arrives at a halting place called
Laurent du Pont.&nbsp; Thence the road becomes more steep,
winding along ledges of rock, whence, through openings, one looks
down on pine woods, and sees the stream fighting its way, like
our contested passage through this troublesome world.&nbsp; We
reached a thick forest at the top of the pass, and came to the
monastery&mdash;a pile, of buildings sheltered on green
uplands.&nbsp; There were before us long walls, square towers,
and steep roofs, dappled with dormer windows; here and there was
a slender spire.&nbsp; The buildings stand 4268 feet above the
level of the sea, and <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>one of the corridors is 660 feet
long.&nbsp; The original foundation dates far back; but little of
what one now sees is older than the seventeenth century.&nbsp;
The founder was the famous Bruno, who, with six companions,
retreated to this spot so secluded and desolate.&nbsp;
<i>Chartre</i> signifies a prison, but it also expresses what we
mean by the word <i>charter</i>.&nbsp; The buildings have been
seven times destroyed, but in the seventeenth century the convent
reached its meridian glory.</p>
<p>No sooner had we entered the penetralia of the building, than
we saw notices requesting visitors not to smoke, nor loiter, nor
speak loudly; and in the distance were monks with white cloaks
and cowls, gliding about like ghosts from the other world.&nbsp;
Pictures of Carthusian convents were hanging on the corridor
walls; and the Chapter House exhibited badly painted portraits of
past generals.&nbsp; Following our guide, we entered a vaulted
cloister, with windows on one side and doors on the other,
bearing texts of Scripture, such as &ldquo;Narrow is the way
which leadeth unto life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whosoever he be of you
that forsaketh not all that he hath cannot be My
disciple.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stations of the Cross are hung upon the
walls; through a window are caught glimpses of a green garden,
bright and cheery <a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>amidst sombre appearances all round.&nbsp; The
dormitories have each a cupboard-like bed, a little reading desk,
a stove, directions for novices, a statuette of the Virgin, and a
crucifix.&nbsp; There are workshops fitted up with lathes, and a
small chapel with an altar cloth, covered with skulls and
cross-bones.&nbsp; Inscriptions such as &ldquo;Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity,&rdquo; expressed the characteristic
feeling of the inmates.&nbsp; The library is handsome, well
fitted up, with beautifully bound books.</p>
<p>Visitors are not admitted to the monastic chapel; but from a
tribune they are permitted to look down on the ante-chapel, and
witness matins at the appointed hour.&nbsp; The brotherhood are
remarkable for industry, being graziers of cattle, and
manufacturers of liqueurs.</p>
<p>The clock struck six just after we left the monastery, and a
calm summer evening shone on the old walls, the green pastures,
and the climbing woods.&nbsp; The pass, as we descended, struck
us as almost equal to the Via Mala in grandeur, united with
beauties which the other scene can scarcely boast.&nbsp;
Road-making, tree-felling, saw-mills, iron works, distilleries,
cement manufactories, told of widespread industry.&nbsp; The old
monastery lay behind; modern enterprise stood out before.</p>
<p><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>We
were rapidly driven through Laurent du Pont, as the star-studded
sky, streaked by the Milky Way, overarched the region.&nbsp; We
noticed glow-worms in the hedges, brought out by advancing night,
and presently the wide vale at the foot of the descending road
seemed dusted with bright-looking objects like glow-worms; but
they turned out to be the lamps of Voirons, where we took the
train for Grenoble, and finished a day of remarkable
interest.</p>
<h2><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
1883&ndash;1885</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this period I was engaged in the
preparation of &ldquo;The Spanish Reformers,&rdquo; and to give
vividness to the work, with regard to local scenery and
circumstances, I resolved in March 1883 to visit the Peninsula,
where I might gather what was possible for the accomplishment of
my purpose.</p>
<p>My daughter was my companion, and had been studying Spanish to
render me assistance.&nbsp; We travelled through France on our
way to the north-east of Spain.</p>
<p>We halted at Lyons: in the neighbourhood of it persecution
occurred in the second century; but unlike what obtained in Spain
three hundred years ago, it was not the persecution of one class
of Christians by another, but the persecution of the Church by a
heathen world.&nbsp; We find embedded in <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>the
Ecclesiastical History by Eusebius a document giving an account
of sufferings by believers at that time who were in the
neighbourhood of Lyons.&nbsp; Vienne, with its glass houses and
metal foundries, coalpits and smoke, is now passed by travellers,
without any interest; but in the second century it took
precedence of Lyons, and had a flourishing Church, a member of
which&mdash;Blandina, a maiden slave&mdash;suffered death as the
penalty of her faith. <a name="citation315"></a><a
href="#footnote315" class="citation">[315]</a></p>
<p>We tarried a night at Lyons, drove round the city, saw the
cathedral and other buildings, and ascended a hill on which
stands the church of Notre Dame de Fourvi&egrave;res, covered and
crowded with ex-votive offerings, in return for miraculous cures
by the Virgin.&nbsp; From the elevation views are caught of
extensive scenery.&nbsp; Thence we proceeded to Arles, rich in
Roman remains, including a magnificent amphitheatre.&nbsp; The
cathedral of St. Trophimus said to have been one of St.
Paul&rsquo;s disciples, is an interesting specimen of twelfth or
thirteenth century architecture.&nbsp; Thence we proceeded to
Narbonne, a quaint old town, of importance in Roman times, with
ramparts still of some interest, and quaint streets, through
which we had an evening&rsquo;s ramble.&nbsp; The cathedral of
St. Just is an unfinished edifice of <a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>the thirteenth century, with some
good tracery in the windows.&nbsp; The city is distant from the
sea only about eight miles.&nbsp; Thence we proceeded to
Perpignan, and, entering Spain, reached our destination at
Figueras, where we were kindly welcomed by our friends, <a
name="citation316"></a><a href="#footnote316"
class="citation">[316]</a> who are engaged in evangelistic work
amongst Roman Catholic Spaniards.</p>
<p>Figueras is a considerable town, which greatly interested
us.&nbsp; It was the day before Good Friday that we arrived, and
we were much amused by a number of boys with wooden mallets
vehemently beating the pavement, which was explained to us as a
custom indicative of hatred to the Jews for having crucified our
Lord; what the Jews had to do with Figueras I could not make
out.&nbsp; In the evening there was a procession through the
streets of a truly magnificent description.&nbsp; It consisted of
the gentry in the town, attired in antique Spanish costumes, and
presented an imposing spectacle.&nbsp; Ladies personated the
Virgin Mary and other Scripture characters, and numerous candles
carried by attendants made a splendid illumination.&nbsp; On the
following day, Good Friday, we had a drive into the country,
where we saw and heard of what went on in the way of missionary
work conducted by our zealous <a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>friends.&nbsp; In the evening we
visited a neighbouring church which was illuminated, and crowded
with people engaged in religious service.&nbsp; After this, we
saw in the streets a long procession, including penitents, who
were fettered with chains.</p>
<p>From Figueras we travelled to Barcelona, a city rich in
commercial enterprise and wealth, the streets crowded with people
and enlivened by carriages of grandees and wealthy merchants, as
well as by vehicles employed in humble traffic.&nbsp; The
cathedral is a noble edifice, in which we attended Divine worship
on Easter Sunday.&nbsp; A priest with difficulty made his way
through a densely-crowded congregation to the altar steps, where
he knelt and prayed, and then mounted a temporary pulpit.&nbsp;
As soon as he opened his lips, all eyes were turned towards
him.&nbsp; His voice was marvellous and his attitudes were
graceful; sometimes he was persuasive, then indignant, always
earnest; women wept, tears ran down men&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; The
sermon was on our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.&nbsp; He insisted on
our duty to remember Christ&mdash;&ldquo;the Way, the Truth, and
the Life&rdquo;; and he showed the effect of this on the hearts
and lives of believers.&nbsp; He dwelt on the duty of repentance,
and urged people to come to Christ.&nbsp; In a touching manner he
referred to his own experience, and exhorted the congregation <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>to believe,
pray, and obey the Gospel; saying over and over again,
&ldquo;<i>Haber f&egrave;</i>, <i>f&egrave;</i>,
<i>f&egrave;</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Have faith, faith,
faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I met with signs of Protestant work going on in Barcelona, and
a gentleman residing there at the time, told me of what the
British and Foreign Bible Society was doing in Spain.&nbsp; He
gave it, as his opinion, that it exceeded other instrumentalities
in the efficiency of its service.&nbsp; I find it stated by a
Spanish author, that Barcelona abounds in mendicancy, and I have,
as I write, a woodcut before me representing a pitiable crowd of
beggars at one of the cathedral doors. <a
name="citation318"></a><a href="#footnote318"
class="citation">[318]</a></p>
<p>Next to Barcelona, we visited Tarragona, travelling there by
rail.&nbsp; Tarragona is situated on an eminence commanding a
fine view of the Mediterranean, and I was much interested in the
architecture of the cathedral, a building of the eleventh
century, fully described by Street in his work on &ldquo;The
Gothic Architecture of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst tarrying at Tarragona, I made an excursion to Poblet,
rarely visited by English, though frequented by French and German
travellers.&nbsp; This place is distinguished by monastic remains
of extraordinary magnificence.&nbsp; You wander <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>amongst
courts, cloisters, and dormitories, through stately halls, which
once boasted of a magnificent library rich in MSS.; through a
palace appropriated for the use of royal and noble visitants; and
through a stately church with a nave of seven bays.&nbsp; The
architectural grandeur of the whole is amazing; I was surprised
to learn that it is so rarely seen by our countrymen.&nbsp; Kings
and nobles were brought there for interment, and in that respect
it vies with our Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; At Poblet shattered
tombs may still be seen; and few, if any, but Spaniards of purest
blood, were permitted to sleep within the monastic walls.&nbsp; A
marble slab may be seen covering the remains of an Englishman,
described in the Spanish guide book as &ldquo;Felipe de,
Marqu&eacute;se de Malbursi y de Cacharloch,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp;
Wharton was the English name of this well-known personage, who
was made Knight of the Garter by James II.&nbsp; He had become a
Roman Catholic, but his father was a distinguished English
Nonconformist.</p>
<p>Our next destination was Valencia, to which city we travelled
by rail, enchanted as we approached it, by beautiful scenery
which one does not find abundant in Spain.&nbsp; Augustus Hare
breaks out rather rapturously respecting his approach: &ldquo;Day
<a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>broke in
time to show us the first vision of tall palms, with their
feathery foliage, rising black against one of Tennyson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;daffodil skies,&rsquo; which above, still deep blue, was
filled with stars.&rdquo;&nbsp; The groves and gardens appeared
to me very beautiful; and the soil is so fertile, that lucerne is
sown fifteen times in the course of a year.&nbsp; Valencia has
battlemented walls; and its arched gate, the Puerta de Sarranos,
reminds one of old English barbicans.&nbsp; It is an Oriental
kind of place, and has charmingly arched entrances for
light&mdash;<i>agimes</i>,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, openings by which
the sun enters.&nbsp; The city is full of memories, connected
with the Cid, which I have not space to introduce; but I may
mention that precursors of the Reformation entered the city in
1350,&mdash;under the name of Beghards, who figure rather
prominently in the religious history of that period.</p>
<p>The Cathedral of Valencia is a noble edifice, and has one
magnificent entrance of richly decorated Gothic.&nbsp; There is,
in the Colegio del Patriarca, a ceremony every week on Friday,
which attracts a number of people.&nbsp; It consists in letting
down an altar piece by concealed machinery; and then, by
withdrawing a curtain, there is disclosed a large picture of our
Saviour on the Cross.&nbsp; Those who assemble <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>to witness
this ceremony, are required to appear in mourning.&nbsp; I
explored the city from end to end, and found it by no means so
uninteresting as some represent it.</p>
<p>We started in the evening for Cordova, a long distance; but as
it was accomplished in darkness, I noticed nothing by the way,
except stoppages at stations and a change of trains.&nbsp; We
crossed the Sierra Morena, which, in some places, at least, must
be very magnificent, if one may judge from an engraving of tall
rocks facing each other, leaving scarcely room for muleteers to
pass between.&nbsp; The approach to Cordova is inviting, and the
Moorish city is beheld amidst a fertile region, across which runs
the Guadalquivir.</p>
<p>We had been invited to take up our abode with an exemplary
Scotch missionary in the city.&nbsp; The sojourn was in a quiet
street at a comfortable dwelling, with an open space in the
middle of the residence, planted with shrubs.&nbsp; Upon this we
looked down from windows in our apartments.&nbsp; One room on the
ground floor is sufficiently large to receive a congregation of
about fifty people.&nbsp; We were there on a Sunday and attended
worship in the evening.</p>
<p>The Mosque of Cordova, now a cathedral, is one <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>of the most
wonderful buildings in the world.&nbsp; The surrounding walls are
from thirty to sixty-feet high.&nbsp; The courtyard measures 430
feet by 210.&nbsp; Once there were nineteen entrance gates, now
there is but one.&nbsp; Formerly there were inside the mosque
1200 monolithic columns, now there are only 850.&nbsp; What is
the <i>coro</i>, or choir, of the cathedral, was erected in the
sixteenth century, after the Mohammedan mosque had become a
Catholic church.&nbsp; We had pleasant walks and drives in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The next celebrated place in our route was the far-famed
Granada, of which expectations were highly raised, without any
disappointment.&nbsp; We wandered about the Alhambra for several
days.&nbsp; The Hall of the Lions, the Hall of the Ambassadors,
and the Hall of the Abencerrages,&mdash;with their arches and
columns, courts and colonnades, fountains and flowers,&mdash;kept
us spel-bound day by day.&nbsp; We read Washington Irving on the
fascinating spots which he describes so vividly.&nbsp; We could
but bow to his relentless fidelity, where he assures us that,
after examining Arabic authorities and letters, written by
Boabdil&rsquo;s contemporaries, he was convinced, that the whole
collection is fictitious with a few grains of truth at the
bottom.</p>
<p><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>The
fame of the Alhambra swallows up all which is wonderful in
Granada, but, the city retains much besides worthy of a
traveller&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; The prospect you have of the
place, the plain, and the surrounding hills, is magnificent; and
the cathedral, commenced in 1529, after the defeat and banishment
of the Moors, is a building of architectural interest.&nbsp; It
contains the Capella Real, with the tomb of Ferdinand and
Isabella; also of Philip the Handsome, and his wife Juana,
&ldquo;Crazy Jane,&rdquo; as she was called, mother of the famous
Charles V.&nbsp; The granddaughter tells us: &ldquo;She committed
her soul to God and gave thanks to Him, that, at length, He
delivered her from all her sorrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; In connection
with the cathedral, we meet with Fernando de Talavera, better
known by Spaniards than by Englishmen.&nbsp; Though he remained a
Roman Catholic, he deviated from the common opinions and usages
of his age.&nbsp; The Carthusians have a monastery outside the
city, and on visiting it, I found pictures of English priests,
reported to have been martyrs at the period of the
Reformation.&nbsp; No doubt their sufferings are exaggerated on
the monastic walls, but it is a fact, beyond reasonable doubt,
that there were Roman Catholics put to death by English
Protestants.</p>
<p>We started one morning from Granada for Seville, <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>and, on
crossing the Vega by the railway, we saw a good barley crop in
the month of April.&nbsp; At Bobadillo, we got on the Seville
line, and found the country improve as we came near to the city
on the banks of the Guadalquivir.&nbsp; There, instead of antique
and uncomfortable <i>fondas</i>, travellers meet with spacious
and well-furnished hotels.&nbsp; We tarried several days in the
city.</p>
<p>The cathedral, of course, was the first object of interest;
and, as soon as possible, we repaired to it, and received an
overpowering impression, as we looked above, beneath,
around.&nbsp; Above there is the magnificent roof, spanning the
breadth of the temple; beneath there lies a large slab covering
the remains, not, as sometimes supposed, of Columbus, who
discovered America, but of Fernando, his son.&nbsp; In Holy Week
an immense Greek cross, carved in wood, is raised over the spot,
and lighted up so as to produce an indescribable effect.&nbsp;
The <i>coro</i>, or choir, is as grand, though in another way, as
the nave which leads up to it.&nbsp; In an upper part of the
edifice there are preserved MSS. and other memorials of
unrivalled Spanish discoveries, and they were freely shown to
us.&nbsp; We went to the Museum, and feasted on Murillo&rsquo;s
pictures.&nbsp; We were also taken by a friend to see another
work of the same artist, since presented, I am told, to the
Pope.</p>
<p><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>Seville was headquarters of the Protestant cause.&nbsp;
The Reformation did not penetrate much below the hidalgo
class.&nbsp; It left the masses almost untouched.&nbsp; In
Seville stood the Inquisition prison, till it was removed to a
palace in the Calle san Mario.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Mr.
Wiffen in 1842, &ldquo;while gazing on the edifice with feelings
of awe, I recalled to remembrance those martyrs for the truth,
and, at the same time, I listened with painful interest to the
narration made to me by a Spanish gentleman, of an attack on
those very premises at a recent period by an infuriated populace,
who suffered but few of the friars confined there for political
offences, to escape with life.&nbsp; The building having taken
fire some perished in the flames, while others fell by the hands
of the assassins.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tables were turned just then,
priests were in prison for political crimes, as heretics had been
incarcerated in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Old Venetian political policy was carried out against
Protestantism, and the Inquisition office, with opened ears,
listened for whisperings of heresy.&nbsp; Horrors went on in
secret places.&nbsp; I cannot relate them, but they may be found
in what is written by Limborch and Llorente.&nbsp; A few miles
from Seville is the monastery of San Isidore&mdash;the cradle of
the Spanish Reformation&mdash;and I visited the building <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>with deep
interest.&nbsp; The chapel remains in tolerable repair, and is
used as a parish church.&nbsp; The chapter-house, sacristy and
cloisters are preserved.&nbsp; Ancient pictures hang on the
walls, and old embroidered vestments are shown to visitors.&nbsp;
Bibles and Protestant books were of old secretly brought within
the walls, and monks began to read them.</p>
<p>I have described Seville Cathedral and its treasures at some
length in my volume on &ldquo;Spanish Reformers, their Memories
and Dwelling Places.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot repeat here what has
been said there.&nbsp; But let me say, the city is full of
interest to travellers, hotels are comfortable, shops are well
stocked with curiosities, manufactories are hives of industry,
and pictures by great masters are found in churches and private
houses.&nbsp; I was enchanted with some of the Murillos, and
would advise every traveller to visit the Sala de Murillo in
Seville.</p>
<p>I should have been glad to have prolonged my stay, and to have
revisited spots full of historic interest.&nbsp; But I had much
before me to see and study in the interior and north of Spain;
therefore, though unwillingly, we took the train one night for
Madrid, making that a starting point for other explorations.</p>
<p>I may mention that during our stay at Madrid we were
entertained in a curious straggling house, <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>occupied by
Dr. Fliedner, a minister, who acted as chaplain to the German
Embassy.&nbsp; The house, it is said, was occupied by the famous
Escovedo, secretary to the still more famous Don Juan of Austria;
and one night as he was returning home six ruffians waylaid him,
between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, and inflicted on him
wounds, of which he died in half an hour.&nbsp; Peres, a great
villain who hated Don Juan, is said to have obtained the sanction
of Philip II. for this abominable deed, prompted by the discovery
of an amour between Escovedo and the Princess of Eboli.&nbsp; It
is a horrible story of crime and vice, common in the secret
annals of Spain.</p>
<p>In Madrid I had the privilege of using the public library, and
found there a large collection of English and French, as well as
Spanish, literature.&nbsp; I am sorry to say, that on the
shelves, many volumes in our language appeared, written by
&ldquo;advanced thinkers,&rdquo; tending to the diffusion of
anti-Christian principles.&nbsp; And, in the windows of
booksellers I noticed works for sale of the same
description.&nbsp; The Bible Society I found at work within
limits marked by law, and I attended one evening a Spanish
congregation gathered by Protestant agency, and had the privilege
of addressing those present, through the medium of an
interpreter.&nbsp; I met with specimens <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>of Spanish
superstition which were very degrading.&nbsp; In one case I saw
papers, with a figure of the Virgin&rsquo;s shoe printed upon
them, sold to ignorant people as a sacred charm.</p>
<p>The Plaza at Madrid is a magnificent square, encompassed by a
line of handsome buildings with a garden, fountains, and an
equestrian statue of Philip III. in the middle.&nbsp; Here some
of the <i>autos</i> were held in the seventeenth century, and in
1869 excavations were made, where incontestable proofs of
burnings appeared in bones, charred wood, chain links, nails and
rivets discovered in the soil.&nbsp; Dr. Manning, in his
&ldquo;Spanish Pictures,&rdquo; wrote soon after the discovery:
&ldquo;I visited the spot, and much as I had heard of the horrors
of the Quemadore, I was not prepared for the sight I beheld;
layer above layer, like the strata of a geological model, were
these silent, but most eloquent witnesses of the murderous
cruelty of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I may here add that I saw other mementoes of the Spanish
Inquisition in underground vaults connected with a house occupied
by the Rev. Mr. Jameson, a Presbyterian clergyman at work in
Madrid.&nbsp; I found recesses walled up, which it was said had
been cells in the days of persecution.</p>
<p>Of course, I visited the immense picture-gallery <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>in Madrid;
but the size and number of rooms with multitudes of paintings on
the walls, were so bewildering, as to make only a confused
impression on my mind.&nbsp; Spanish art has not the charm for me
which it has for many.&nbsp; Velasquez and Murillo, of course,
are pre-eminent.&nbsp; The latter stands first of all in my
estimation.&nbsp; No one, who has seen only the dirty beggar boys
at Dulwich, can have any conception of Murillo&rsquo;s
merits.&nbsp; It is in Seville, however, that he must be studied,
if any one would see him at his best.&nbsp; I found no Murillo in
Madrid which charmed me like those it was my privilege to enjoy
in the Capital of the South.&nbsp; There is a good chapter on
Velasquez and Murillo in Sir E. Head&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook of
Painting&mdash;Spanish School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Velasquez and Murillo are preferred, and preferred with
reason, to all the others, as the most original and
characteristic of their school.&nbsp; These two great painters
are remarkable for having lived in the same time, in the same
school, painted for the same people and of the same age, and yet
to have formed two styles so different and opposite that the most
unlearned can scarcely mistake them, Murillo being all softness,
while Velasquez is all sparkle and vivacity.&rdquo; <a
name="citation329"></a><a href="#footnote329"
class="citation">[329]</a></p>
<p><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>A
curious story is told of a picture by Velasquez&mdash;the
portrait of Adrian Pulido Pareja.&nbsp; Philip IV. coming, as
usual, to see the artist at work, started when he saw this
portrait, and addressing himself to it, exclaimed: &ldquo;What,
art thou still here?&nbsp; Did I not send thee off?&nbsp; How is
it thou art not gone?&rdquo;&nbsp; But seeing the figure did not
salute him, the King discovered his mistake, and, turning to
Velasquez, said: &ldquo;I assure you I was deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We visited the Escorial some distance from Madrid.&nbsp;
Philip II. is buried there.&nbsp; Its situation is wild and
desolate&mdash;a vast expanse of undulations, scarcely to be
called mountainous, except in the distance, where snow-streaked
sierras send cutting blasts over the slate roofs and against the
grey stone walls.&nbsp; The building itself looks like a
manufactory, at best like spacious barracks; one may think it
something between a prison and a convent, or rather a combination
of the two; at any rate its cold, stern, repulsive exterior is a
fair type of the builder&rsquo;s character and influence.&nbsp;
The only objects of much interest, and they are in truth most
melancholy, one finds in the monkish apartments, the monastic
chapel, and the costly sepulchre of the founder and his
family.&nbsp; A long and narrow room is shown with brick floor
and <a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>leathern chairs, where he dined.&nbsp; Next to it is
another, only separated by folding doors, from which, when open,
the despot borrowed the light by which he wrote his
despatches.&nbsp; In this room is a plain oak table, with three
brass ink bottles on one side, and a velvet writing-case in the
middle; these, with the leather-bottomed chair on which he sat,
are carefully preserved.&nbsp; From this room you pass into a
third, low and dark, a mere cell, whence through an opening in
the wall, the altar of the monastery chapel may be seen; there he
spent his last hours, after being, like his prototype Herod,
smitten by an angel of the Lord, and eaten up of worms; no death
could be more horrible.&nbsp; That chapel is an enormous marble
building, most costly, most dreary, and into one corner of the
<i>coro</i> he would sometimes steal, to perform his devotions
with the Jeronymite brotherhood.&nbsp; The sepulchre under the
high altar is reached by a slippery marble staircase; and round
the sides of the vault are placed sarcophagi, one above another;
Charles V. occupies the topmost position, Philip being placed
under his father.&nbsp; The dismalness of the spot is unrelieved
by any emblem or suggestion of Christian hope: not even such a
ray falls over it as that which <a name="page332"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>lighted up the mind of the heathen
Cicero, when he spoke of meeting in the future life an assembly
of noble souls.</p>
<p>Toledo is about forty miles from Madrid, and is easily reached
by rail.&nbsp; Scenery on the way is uninteresting till you get
near the city, when, crossing the bridge over the Tagus, you are
reminded of the rocky seat on which sits Durham Cathedral.&nbsp;
Winding through narrow streets of the city and past
Moorish-looking entrances into courts, called <i>patios</i>, I
thought Toledo was a sort of album, with ornamented leaves on one
side, and romantic legends on the other.&nbsp; At the foot of St.
Martin&rsquo;s bridge lies a cave, where Roderic, the last of the
Goths, saw the lady whose seduction caused the Moorish invasion;
which invasion robbed the monarch of his crown.&nbsp; The
cathedral is grand indeed.&nbsp; The cloisters are full of rich
tracery, elegant pilasters crowned with statuettes, and open
windows adorned by elaborate tracery.&nbsp; The interior is
worthy of its surroundings and its approach; and I was deeply
interested in the Mozarabic chapel.&nbsp; There is preserved a
thin folio, bearing the name of the chapel, and containing a
Latin service, used there every day.&nbsp; With it is connected
an absurd tradition, the story and meaning <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>of which
are disputed by arch&aelig;ologists.&nbsp; With the cathedral you
have connected the name of Bartolomo Carranza, called the Black
Friar, whose long story is entwined round the Council of Trent,
and with Philip of Spain, who married the English Queen
Mary.&nbsp; He attended Charles V. on his deathbed, and was
accused of heresy; and yet the Pope raised for him a monument in
commemoration of his virtues.&nbsp; It is said Carranza believed
in the doctrine of Justification by Faith; and his history from
beginning to end appears to me a hopeless puzzle. <a
name="citation333"></a><a href="#footnote333"
class="citation">[333]</a></p>
<p>In Toledo is the &ldquo;Square Market,&rdquo; as it is called;
and here occurred bullfights and burnings,&mdash;one of the
latter in 1560, when Philip II. was present.</p>
<p>We returned from Toledo to Madrid and leaving the capital, a
week or so afterwards, travelled to Valladolid.&nbsp; The chief,
indeed the only, architectural monument in Valladolid is found in
the combined edifices of San Pablo&rsquo;s Church, and San
Gregorio&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; The facade of the former is an
elaborate example of Gothic flamboyant; but the gateway of the
latter with its heraldic ornaments, <a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>coats of arms, statues in niches,
and numerous figures, has a bewildering effect.&nbsp; Columbus
and Cervantes both resided in this city; the former died in the
Calle de Colon, the latter wrote the first part of &ldquo;Don
Quixote&rdquo; in the Calle de Rastro.</p>
<p>Ford, in his voluminous &ldquo;Guide to Spain,&rdquo; at the
beginning of a notice respecting Valladolid, says: &ldquo;In the
first street, above the bridge, is the site of the old
Inquisition, the Court of Chancery, and the prison&rdquo;; adding
the remark: &ldquo;The great Chancery or Court of Appeal for the
north of Spain was moved to the present building by Ferdinand and
Isabella.&nbsp; The inscribed motto, &lsquo;<i>Jura fidem ac
p&aelig;nam reddit sua munera cunctus</i>&rsquo;&mdash;seems
rather strong, to all who know what Spanish <i>justitia</i> is,
let alone Chancery in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Incipient stages of reformation come before us in this
city.&nbsp; One sees in imagination &ldquo;The Calle del Doctor
Cazalla,&rdquo; of Jewish extraction, a man of renown for his
Protestant work, born in 1510; he had been Court preacher and
champion of orthodoxy, until he came under the influence of
German reformers.&nbsp; But he seems by no means to have been a
Martin Luther, for, when he was accused of dogmatising in a
Valladolid conventicle, <a name="page335"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>he solemnly denied the fact, and
said he had not <i>indoctrinated</i> other people with his own
views.&nbsp; His end was not heroic.&nbsp; After being dislocated
on the rack, he recanted with a hope of life, but he found no
escape.&nbsp; The night before his execution, when acquainted
with the final sentence, the poor man said, &ldquo;I must prepare
to die in the grace of God, for it is impossible for me to add to
what I have said, without falsehood.&rdquo;&nbsp; We learn that,
after all, he did not break with Rome, but received absolution;
and then, instead of being burnt, he was strangled.&nbsp; His
house was pulled down, the spot strewn with salt, and a column
placed where the building had stood.&nbsp; An inscription upon it
stated: &ldquo;Lutheran heretics assembled here in conventicle
against the Catholic faith and the Roman Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
namesake, Francesco de Vibero Cazalla, more valiant for the
truth, remained constant to the last.&nbsp; Another martyr
behaved heroically, only lamenting that his wife abjured, and he
saw her dressed as a penitent.&nbsp; But we are told the
husband&rsquo;s look never departed from her eyes.&nbsp; In my
&ldquo;Spanish Reformers&rdquo; I have given a detailed account
of several sufferers for the truth at Valladolid.</p>
<p>Of the cathedral, Street, in his work on &ldquo;Spanish <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>Architecture,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Nothing could ever
cure the hideous unsightliness of the exterior&rdquo;; and he
adds: &ldquo;The side elevation remains as Herrera, the
architect, designed it, and is really valuable as <i>a
warning</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author describes Sta. Maria
l&rsquo;Antigua, close to the cathedral, as the most attractive
church in Valladolid.&nbsp; He says of the city: &ldquo;It was
too rich and prosperous, during an age of much work, and little
taste, to have left medi&aelig;val architecture of any real
value; yet as a modern city it is, in parts, gay and attractive;
being, after Madrid, the most important city of the north of
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; From what I saw of the place, I can endorse
this opinion.</p>
<p>We reached Burgos, after a short journey, and found the town
much less interesting and agreeable than Valladolid, but the
cathedral is incomparably superior.&nbsp; The picture of its
facade, doors, windows, and towers, is vividly imprinted on my
memory.</p>
<p>We were now approaching the border of France, and I had
memories revived of a first dip into Spain, years before.&nbsp;
Though the land be still the same and the skies the same,
different feelings arise from departure out of a country,
compared with one&rsquo;s entrance into it.&nbsp; We reached a
new and very <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>comfortable hotel at San Sebastian, and there I revived
recollections of curiosity and interest, felt years before, when
I first crossed the border and became acquainted with the
costumes, the manners and customs of Spanish life.</p>
<h2><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
1885</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> year I paid my third and last
visit to Rome.&nbsp; A comparison of the city and neighbourhood
as they were during my first visit with what now appeared, was
very striking.&nbsp; Formerly it retained much of the appearance
it had in the previous century.&nbsp; There were narrow streets,
bad pavements, old-fashioned houses; monks and friars of
different orders, white, black, grey, thronging thoroughfares;
cardinals&rsquo; coaches with liveried servants, in gay coats and
cocked hats; the Pope, driving down the Corso, whilst the whole
population watched him with reverence on bended knees: now these
old sights had vanished; comparatively few ecclesiastics could be
recognised by their costumes; only companies of boys, in red or
blue collegiate garb, attracted attention by contrast with other
people.&nbsp; At Easter in the olden time the ceremonies at St.
Peter&rsquo;s were gorgeous, the illumination <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>of the dome
brilliant, the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo unrivalled: now
Mass on Easter Sunday was far from imposing, there was no feet
washing, no dinner to poor pilgrims, no <i>Miserere</i> in the
Sistine chapel, no blaze of candles in the Pauline.&nbsp; The
Forum had formerly lines of trees, groups of cattle, peasants in
rural costume; now marble sculptures had been brought to
light.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of St. John Lateran had been waste
and void; now it was covered with modern houses.&nbsp; What a
change in the Fontana, outside Rome, the traditional site of St.
Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom.&nbsp; The monastery, when I had seen it
before was desolate, now it was surrounded by abundant
vegetation; the culture of the eucalyptus plant being the secret
of this transformation.</p>
<p>Hare laments, in the following strain, changes which had
occurred in the city and were to be regretted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The baths of Caracalla, stripped of all
their verdure and shrubs, and deprived alike of the tufted
foliage amid which Shelley wrote, and of the flowery carpet which
so greatly enhanced their lonely solemnity, are now a series of
bare featureless walls standing in a gravelly waste, and possess
no more attraction than the ruins of a London <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>warehouse.&nbsp; The Coliseum, no longer &lsquo;a
garlanded ring,&rsquo; is bereaved of everything which made it so
lovely and so picturesque; while botanists must for ever deplore
the incomparable and strangely unique &lsquo;Flora of the
Coliseum,&rsquo; which Signor Rosa has caused to be carefully
annihilated; even the roots of the shrubs having been extracted
by the firemen, though, in pulling them out, more of the building
has come down than five hundred years of time would have
injured.&nbsp; In the Basilica of Constantine, the whole of the
beautiful covering of shrubs with which nature had protected the
vast arches, has been removed, and the rain soaking into the
unprotected upper surface, will soon bring them down.&nbsp; Nor
has the work of the destroyer been confined to the Pagan
antiquities, the early Christian porches of S. Prassede and S.
Pudenziana, with their valuable terra-cotta ornaments, have been
so smeared with paint and yellow-wash as to be irrecognisable;
many smaller but precious Christian antiquities, such as the lion
of the Santi Apostoli, have disappeared altogether.&nbsp; And in
return for these destructions and abductions Rome has been
given&mdash;what?&nbsp; Quantities of hideous false rock-work
painted brown in all the public gardens; a Swiss cottage and a
clock which goes by water <a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>forced in amidst the statues and
sarcophagi of the Pincio; and the having the passages of the
Capitol painted all over with the most flaring scarlet and blue,
so as utterly to destroy the repose and splendour of its ancient
statues.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We visited a very old house in the Ghetto, where at the time
services were held by a company of Jewish converts.&nbsp; Rude,
uncomfortable and mean, the place looked to any one accustomed to
modern churches; yet that dreary apartment, up a flight of
stairs, was typical of places for Christian worship in the
imperial city of the second century.&nbsp; Few fashionable people
know the existence of the room I mention, and attendants shyly
ascend the dirty steps, wishing to be unobserved; just so, no
doubt, it was with some of the companies in the second century
who in Rome &ldquo;sang praises to Jesus as to God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the reigns of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus
Aurelius, little was known about the Gospel by the higher
ranks.&nbsp; Emperors, consuls, magistrates, marched along the
streets in haughty indifference, or with contemptuous hate
towards the new superstition.</p>
<p>Much inquiry has arisen as to where Paul lived during his
captivity in Rome.&nbsp; A local tradition affirms that in a
subterranean church dedicated to <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>the Virgin Mary, which you pass
going down the Corso, you have the very &ldquo;hired
house,&rdquo; where for two years the Apostle lived.&nbsp; In the
crypt-like place, there is nothing which looks like a human
dwelling; and the tradition itself, in a city where such
traditions abound, is of little if any value.&nbsp; A house in
the Ghetto, extremely ancient, was pointed out to me by Dr.
Philip, a Jewish missionary, as the probable spot; but his idea
seems to have had nothing to rest upon, except that this old
building is in the Jews&rsquo; quarter.&nbsp; What is fatal to
the identification of the &ldquo;hired house&rdquo; in either of
these spots is that the New Testament indicates it as connected
with lodgings occupied by the Pretorian guard.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;soldier that kept him&rdquo; would not be far away from
comrades; and soldiers in general would be accommodated in the
Pretorian camp, of which traces exist near the Porta Pia&mdash;a
long distance from the Corso and the Ghetto.</p>
<p>My third visit to Rome was the close of my foreign
travels.&nbsp; A word more in reference to them.&nbsp; Most
frequently on my way to other countries, I passed through France
to Paris, either by Calais and Amiens, or by Havre and
Rouen.&nbsp; Let me refer for a moment to the cathedral at
Amiens, one of the wonders of the world&mdash;the largest place
<a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>of
worship I know, except Cologne Cathedral, St. Peter&rsquo;s at
Rome, and St. Sophia at Constantinople.&nbsp; It takes away
one&rsquo;s breath to look up at its rich clerestory, and its
roof, 140 feet high, half as high again as that of Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; Rouen has architectural beauty, and an historical
interest beyond other French cities.&nbsp; The Church of St. Ouen
surpasses the cathedral, and the Palais de Justice is a beautiful
specimen of Civic Gothic.&nbsp; But associations of what happened
in that city, during the fifteenth century, surpass its material
monuments.&nbsp; Poor Joan of Arc&mdash;most touching example of
self-delusion and self-sacrifice the world ever saw&mdash;how she
absorbs interest as one stands in the Place de Pucelle, where she
was burnt, the victim of French ingratitude and English
revenge!&nbsp; Paris is so well known by everybody that no notice
need be taken of it here.</p>
<p>We now return to Great Britain.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1885 the Evangelical Alliance met at
Edinburgh and Glasgow, and in the latter city I was entertained
by the Lord Provost, Sir William and Lady Collins, and met there,
Admiral Sir W. King Hall and his lady, with whom a pleasant
friendship sprang up, and I accepted an invitation to visit them
at their home, but his death <a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>soon afterwards deprived me of the
anticipated pleasure.&nbsp; They appeared to me spiritually
minded people; their society with that of our excellent host and
hostess filled me with great pleasure.&nbsp; At the meeting I
lamented, as I am accustomed to do, our numerous ecclesiastical
divisions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we are as Christians connected with
denominational churches, and we may be compared to persons living
in an island city, where we have our own municipal regulations,
where some are in what may be called Episcopalian Square, some
occupying Methodist Terrace, some residing in Congregational
Road, and some liking to live by the waterside.&nbsp; Whilst
these differences exist amongst us in this world, surely it
sometimes crosses our minds that they are distinctions of a very
temporary nature.&nbsp; The things which are seen are temporal,
but the things not seen are eternal.&nbsp; We are looking away
from what is familiar to what is now rare indeed&mdash;perfect
unity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have long found it to be one of the sorrows incident to old
age to lament the loss of attached friends.&nbsp; In this respect
I was much tried in the year 1886, for I had then to deplore the
death of Lord Chichester, who became acquainted with me through
the medium of the Evangelical <a name="page345"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 345</span>Alliance about twenty years
before.&nbsp; Of late he was unable to attend meetings, but our
intercourse in private continued and increased as years rolled
on.&nbsp; Descendant of Sir John Pelham, who figured in the
French wars, described by Froissart, and an immediate relative of
a well-known political family of the same name in the last
century,&mdash;the Earl became an earnest Christian and an active
philanthropist for more than half a century.&nbsp; Possessed of
wide and varied information respecting men and things, and being
eminently genial and altogether free from ostentation, his
society could not but be agreeable and instructive.&nbsp; It was
a treat to hear him recount incidents and conversations of former
days.&nbsp; At different times he brought within view George IV.,
William IV., the Duke of Wellington, leaders of the Whig party,
and other magnates.&nbsp; He told me that when approaching his
majority his father proposed that he should enter the House of
Commons, and the Duke of Newcastle promised him a seat for
Newark.&nbsp; Before an election arrived the father of young Lord
Pelham died, and the son became a peer.&nbsp; It is remarkable
that the seat intended for him in the Lower House was next
occupied by the now famous William Ewart Gladstone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Grand Old Man,&rdquo; in conversation with <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>my friend
not long before his death, speculated, in his characteristic way,
upon possible consequences to each, had the seat been accepted by
young Lord Pelham.&nbsp; With the Hare family, the Osbornes of
the ducal house of Leeds, the Rev. F. D. Maurice, and other
distinguished persons, the Earl had been intimate, and could tell
many a story about them.&nbsp; Though a thorough Evangelical, and
zealous for all the great truths of Christianity, he was
singularly free from prejudice against people of different
views.&nbsp; He could appreciate goodness wherever it was to be
found.</p>
<p>The Prince Regent, with old Queen Charlotte, paid a visit to
Stanmer, the family seat, near Brighton, when the Earl was a boy,
and an amusing picture in one of the rooms exhibits his Royal
Highness in dandy fashion&mdash;his diminutive mother wearing a
wonderful bonnet, the former earl acting as cicerone, and his
eldest boy riding on a smart pony.&nbsp; The Stanmer Pelhams are
descended, on the female side, from Oliver Cromwell, and have in
their possession the Lord Protector&rsquo;s Bible in four
volumes, a miniature of him, which, I think, belonged to Lady
Falconbridge, and a portrait of His Highness&rsquo;s
mother.&nbsp; It is curious to find these Commonwealth relics
associated with mementoes in <a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>the family arms,&mdash;I refer to
the buckle and strap of Sir John Pelham, who assisted in taking
King John of France prisoner at the battle of Poitiers.&nbsp; In
addition to these memorials, mention may be made of a fine copy
in the library of Walton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Polyglot,&rdquo; with the
rare preface containing a reference to Oliver Cromwell.</p>
<p>Soon after the death of Lord Chichester I lost another friend,
Mr. Cheetham, M.P.&nbsp; His daughters were educated at
Kensington, and hence an intimacy sprang up between us,
cultivated by visits to Eastwood, near Staleybridge, where he
resided.&nbsp; He was a shrewd, energetic man, and figured
conspicuously in the Anti-Corn Law League.&nbsp; His command of
the Lancashire dialect, and his knowledge of Lancashire life,
made him an amusing companion, and Lord John Russell would
sometimes engage him in characteristic recitals, greatly to his
lordship&rsquo;s diversion.&nbsp; Mr. Cheetham had in early life
known much of the Moravians, and ever retained a deep interest in
that remarkable community, though to the end of life he remained
a constant member of the Congregational communion.&nbsp; I have
long been of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s mind: &ldquo;If a man does not
make new acquaintances as he advances through life, he will soon
find himself left alone.&nbsp; A man, sir, should <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>keep <i>his
friendships in constant repair</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On that
principle I have habitually sought to make up for losses from
bereavement.</p>
<p>Here let me add a few lines respecting the Archbishop of York,
Dr. Magee, previously Bishop of Peterborough.</p>
<p>I first met him at Norwich where we took part in a Bible
Meeting, and in the course of my remarks I spoke of
&ldquo;sinking ecclesiastical differences&rdquo; on such an
occasion.&nbsp; Dr. Magee, then Dean of Cork, made an amusing
reference to this, and repeated it with kindness and humour the
next day, as we travelled together by rail to London.&nbsp; We
talked incessantly and at the end he pressed me to visit him at
Cork.&nbsp; Several years passed without our meeting, and then at
a funeral service in Westminster Abbey, he kindly accosted me,
saying, that as I had not been to see him at Cork, I must go and
see him at Peterborough, where, not long before, he had been
appointed bishop.&nbsp; Several visits followed, which I greatly
enjoyed.&nbsp; My impression of him as a brilliant talker, which
I received on our journey from Norwich to London, was now
increased, and nothing could exceed his hospitality and that of
his amiable wife and daughters.&nbsp; We had several drives; and
one day we sat down together in a picturesque churchyard to
discuss ecclesiastical <a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>questions, where, as he said, the
associations and &ldquo;<i>genius loci</i>&rdquo; were on his
side.&nbsp; I forget altogether what passed between us, beyond a
series of <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>, and can only say that we
finished as we began&mdash;he a Churchman, I a Nonconformist, but
both good friends.&nbsp; Once when I was at Peterborough I heard
him preach in the Cathedral for the Bible Society, on the jubilee
of the auxiliary, when he took for his text two passages:
&ldquo;Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld
His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full
of grace and truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He admirably brought out the
Divine and human sides of our blessed Lord&rsquo;s personality
and then presented this as being in harmony with the Divine and
human elements in Holy Writ.&nbsp; As is well known, he did not
use a MS. in the pulpit; nor, as he told me, was he in the habit
of <i>writing</i> his sermons beforehand.&nbsp; He seems to have
had the gift of mental composition, and also of expressing
himself extemporaneously in felicitous diction and with quiet
ease.&nbsp; Nor was he at all verbose, as many fluent speakers
are.</p>
<p>He could tell a story as few people can, sparkling with
humour, and distinct in point.&nbsp; I remember two he told of
Dean Mansel.&nbsp; Taking a lady round St. Paul&rsquo;s, she
paused to look at a figure of Neptune <a name="page350"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>with his <i>trident</i>, remarking
that she was shocked at seeing in a church such heathen
mythology.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; rejoined the Dean,
&ldquo;that looks more like <i>Tridentine</i>
theology.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a public dinner, after a toast to
Reform&mdash;the word on the paper had an <i>e</i> at the
end&mdash;&ldquo;Reform,&rdquo; the Dean remarked, &ldquo;often
ended in an <i>&eacute;meute</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I was preparing for my journey in Spain I met the Bishop at
the Athen&aelig;um, when he told me he was doing the same, and
proposed we should go together, adding that he could help me with
his knowledge of Spanish.&nbsp; I had heard him speak of his
residence in Spain when he was a boy, and I should have been
delighted to fall in with his plan, but found it quite impossible
beforehand with regard to time.&nbsp; However, we agreed to
inquire after each other at consular offices, as we passed from
place to place; but I found I was always too late, or too
soon.&nbsp; When I called at an hotel in Madrid, where he had
been staying, I learned he had just left for the railway; and
after our return, he told me his daughter saw me in the street as
they were hurrying to catch a train.</p>
<p>How many remarkable facts have been related within the last
few years respecting old English houses and estates!</p>
<p>During a visit to Lord Ebury, at Moor Park, <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>he told me
the mansion he occupied had been in the hands of many
distinguished families; and that reminds one of what is said in
the Eastern tale: &ldquo;Call it not a palace but a
caravanserai.&rdquo;&nbsp; It belonged to the Abbot of St.
Albans; to Neville, Archbishop of York; to Henry VII.; to De
Vere, Earl of Oxford; to Cardinal Wolsey; to Lucy, Countess of
Bedford; to Sir John Franklin; to the Earl of Ossory, who sold it
to the Duke of Monmouth, whose Duchess sold it to Mr. Styles, of
South Sea Bubble notoriety, to be afterwards purchased by Lord
Anson.&nbsp; After changing owners again and again, it was
secured by the Marquis of Westminster for his son.&nbsp; Lord
Ebury informed me it had never remained in the same family more
than two generations.&nbsp; There runs a curious story of the
Lady of the Earl of Monmouth, who possessed the estate in the
seventeenth century,&mdash;that her ladyship protested against
the intention of James I., to put his son Prince Charles
&ldquo;into iron boots, to strengthen his joints and
sinews&rdquo;; for he seemed to have been physically as a boy
what he was, in some respects, morally as a man&mdash;very
<i>weak-kneed</i>.</p>
<p>In the course of my recollections, I have had much to say of
foreign tours, and also of journeys in different parts of England
for various religious <a name="page352"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 352</span>purposes; but, in drawing my
personal narrative to a close, I am constrained to add a few
lines, respecting visits to friends in my own county, where I
have enjoyed welcome rests amidst ministerial toils.</p>
<p>One spot, long years ago, where I was wont to seek recreation
was Letheringsett Hall, near Holt, in my native county,
Norfolk.&nbsp; There still lives Mr. Cozens-Hardy, whom I knew as
a boy, about five years old, in days when we worshipped in
Calvert Street Chapel, Norwich.&nbsp; He married a lady whom I
recollect as a girl, and who was long the light of his dwelling,
well known to numerous guests.&nbsp; They hospitably entertained
me in many of my summer holidays, and drove me round the
neighbourhood called &ldquo;The Garden of Norfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Respecting his beloved wife, let me quote words which I wrote for
a short family memorial of her: &ldquo;My last two or three
visits found her weak and frail, but yet a good deal of her old
buoyancy would come back as we sat chatting round the fire.&nbsp;
She seemed to have a quiet faith in the blessed Gospel, but with
some shadows of doubt and fear respecting herself.&nbsp; No bold,
self-asserting professions, as is the case with some, but a
genuine sympathy in reference to the <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>fundamental truths of the Gospel,
which form the resting-place of all true believers.&nbsp; She
seemed to know more of the Valley of Humiliation than of the Land
of Beulah; not often climbing the Delectable Mountains, but by no
means a prisoner in Doubting Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her good
husband has for many years been the main supporter of the
Methodist Society in Holt, and his son, the eminent Q.C., has
been for many years a member of the Congregational Church at
Kensington.&nbsp; The large-hearted Mr. Colman, M.P. for Norwich,
married Mr. Cozens-Hardy&rsquo;s eldest daughter, and in their
hospitable homes at Carrow and Corton I have spent many a happy
day.</p>
<p>I may add here that amongst delightful sojourns in English
homes, I gratefully reckon Stanley Park, the residence of Sir
Samuel Marling; a marine villa at Dawlish, belonging to Sir
Thomas Lea, Bart., also his home at Kidderminster; the beautiful
Quinta on the Welsh border, belonging to Colonel Barnes; and the
marine residence of Miss Cheetham, one of my interesting
school-girls at Kensington.</p>
<p>During the later portion of my residence in Kensington, there
was a considerable increase of Roman Catholics residing in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; When I first went to it, a small place of
worship <a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>sufficed to meet their wants, but before I left, a
large church was built near the Vicarage, and another in the high
road, partly hidden by buildings in front.&nbsp; After the
formation of a Westminster Archiepiscopal see, the last-named
edifice became a pro-cathedral, where Cardinal Manning sometimes
officiated.&nbsp; As I did not hear of numerous conversions, in
the neighbourhood, to the Romish faith, I was curious to know
whence the increase arose, and one day I had a long conversation
on the subject with Monsignor Capel.&nbsp; He informed me that it
was owing largely to an increase in the number of priests who had
come to reside in the place, and who attracted many retired
people who were desirous of opportunities for confession and
spiritual advice.</p>
<p>Hence, I gathered that the increase of Catholics in the
neighbourhood did not arise from local conversions; this
explained what had been a matter of wonder.&nbsp; The Monsignor
was very sociable and communicative, and gave much information
about Romanism, its usages and dignitaries.&nbsp; He had a great
deal to say about the political relations of distinguished
Catholics at that time.&nbsp; How far all his reports were to be
trusted I cannot say.</p>
<p>Certainly there was much activity amongst <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>Hammersmith
Catholics.&nbsp; Within a few doors of my house there was a
sisterhood active in collecting whatever they could of money,
garments, and other benefits for the poor, and on the edge of
Brook Green rose a handsome church, in which special revival
services were held.&nbsp; I attended one of these, and heard a
priest make earnest religious appeals to careless sinners.</p>
<p>There was a nunnery not far off, and from the abbess, through
the medium of a relative, I received an invitation to witness the
ceremony of taking the veil.&nbsp; As a spectacle, there was
something about it pathetic and touching, but as an act of
worship the whole struck me as altogether out of harmony with
primitive Christianity.&nbsp; The relative who conveyed to me the
invitation was the daughter of a Dissenting minister, a girl
highly imaginative and poetical, who made some little stir in
earlier life by a book entitled &ldquo;From Oxford to
Rome,&rdquo; by &ldquo;One that made the Journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She told me of a complimentary note on the subject from a High
Church politician; and I found that she had been thrown a good
deal in the way of Oxford &ldquo;perverts,&rdquo; as they were
called.&nbsp; She became a decided convert, and related to me
much of what she saw amongst her new friends.&nbsp; By her severe
<a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>penances
she broke down her health until she died, but not in the religion
she had recently embraced.&nbsp; The faith of her childhood, in
its simplicity, returned in her last days.&nbsp; I do not know
that she made a formal renunciation of what she had lately
embraced, but she desired no priestly ministrations, and fell
back upon her Bible, and the truths she had accepted in former
days.&nbsp; She joined in her father&rsquo;s prayers by her
bedside, and so went home to rest for ever with her Saviour, whom
she loved amidst all her aberrations of controversial
thought.</p>
<p>Soon after my resignation I paid a summer visit to my friend
Mr. George Moore, of Whitehall, Cumberland, the well-known
merchant prince.&nbsp; There I met Lord Justice Lush, his lady
and daughter, Dr. Moffat, Canon Battersby, and Mr. Smithies, the
&ldquo;Workman&rsquo;s Friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; One day we had Bible
readings in a baronial-looking hall; another day we had outdoor
recreations for the villagers, when a select party dined at the
mansion.&nbsp; In the evenings we were taken to places in the
neighbourhood to attend Bible meetings.&nbsp; On Sunday we went
to church in the morning and to chapel in the evening.&nbsp; Our
host was in all his glory.</p>
<p><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>With
the good judge I had much conversation, and heard something of
his early life story.&nbsp; He had been on the point of settling
in America when he was young, and went there more than once
before he finally made a home in his own country.&nbsp; He was a
beautiful character, an example of Christian politeness, general
intelligence, and professional learning.</p>
<p>In closing notices of towns to which I have paid ministerial
visits, let me mention Hastings, in which, from circumstances to
be mentioned, I feel more than ordinary interest.&nbsp; I do not
speak of the decisive battle on the field of Senlac, which ended
the line of Saxon sovereigns and gave to England a Norman king,
but of personal memories, somewhat unique in their
connection.&nbsp; There was, many years ago, a venerable
Dissenting minister in the town whose congregation was small, and
it was thought by London friends and others, that a new and
larger chapel should be built, and efforts made to revive the
cause.&nbsp; I was invited to preach at the dedication of that
building, and at the close of the sermon found my old
fellow-student, the Rev. James Griffin, was present.&nbsp; He had
just before, owing to impaired health, resigned an important
pastorate at Manchester, and, as he seemed <a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>to be
recovering strength, I suggested that this new chapel at Hastings
might be a suitable sphere for resuming his ministry.&nbsp; The
congregation invited him to become pastor, and he faithfully and
successfully for many years discharged the duties of that
office.&nbsp; It became after a time necessary to erect a still
larger edifice, and, in connection with the opening services, I
was for a second time invited to preach to the people.&nbsp; Mr.
Griffin soon afterwards engaged in the erection of another chapel
outside the town, and when the time for opening it approached he
invited me to undertake that service.&nbsp; Thus a threefold cord
of interest attached me to Nonconformist friends at
Hastings.&nbsp; Moreover, repeated visits on the part of my dear
wife and children increased my interest in the town, and the
hospitality of my friends I remember with gratitude.&nbsp; My
dear friend James Griffin still lives, adorning the doctrine he
has successfully preached for more than half a century.</p>
<p>The autumnal meeting of the Congregational Union was in 1886
held at Norwich.&nbsp; My friend, the Rev. Edward White, was
chairman, and I was invited to read in the old Meeting House,
where I worshipped in my youth, a paper on the early history of
Norfolk Congregationalism.&nbsp; There was a large <a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>gathering
of ministers and other friends in the city, and, as in other
cities and towns, Episcopalians received Nonconformists as their
guests.&nbsp; It was my privilege to be entertained by the
Bishop, with whom I had become acquainted while sojourning under
the roof of his brother, Lord Chichester, at Stanmer Park.&nbsp;
I was received and treated with the greatest kindness and
comfort, and found this Episcopal home a beautiful example of
Christian simplicity and devotion.</p>
<p>The Mayor of the city received members of the Union and other
friends in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall on the Monday evening; and one
afternoon Mr. Colman, M.P. for Norwich, had a large garden-party
in his pleasure grounds.</p>
<p>I availed myself of opportunities during the week for rambling
about scenes of my boyhood, amidst many changes in architecture,
manners and customs, including habits of religious life.&nbsp;
The trade of the city had flowed into new channels; old families
such as I knew in my boyhood were no more.&nbsp; New faces I saw
everywhere, and pensive thoughts were naturally suggested when
one traversed memories of seventy years.&nbsp; How different had
been my lot from what it might have been!&nbsp; Church and
Dissent did not stand in the same relations to each other as they
had done <a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
360</span>once.&nbsp; There was more mutual charity, more, I
believe and trust, of real religion.&nbsp; Certainly,
Evangelicalism had made way in the Establishment, and was not
regarded as it had been in days gone by.</p>
<p>I took a ramble outside the old city, and called on young
friends; and so caught glimpses touching borders of auld lang
syne.</p>
<p>It fell to my lot to occupy a bedroom in the palace exactly to
my taste.&nbsp; It is described by Blomefield in his
&ldquo;History of Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lined with carved
wainscot brought from the demolished abbey of St. Bennet in the
Holm, retaining still the arms of that abbey&mdash;of the Veres,
and others, particularly those of Sir John Fastolff, their great
benefactor.&nbsp; There were also busts of heroes and remarkable
men and women, &ldquo;brought hither by Bishop Rugg.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The place recalled images of old, and stories which had
interested me in youth; if they did not people my dreams, they
coloured my meditations.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;Recollections of a Long Life&rdquo; began with a
notice of being born in Norwich; and as the last visit to my
birthplace was at the time now indicated, I think it is a fitting
point for terminating my narrative.</p>
<h2><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> completing this volume I propose
to take a survey of what I have seen and noticed, amongst
distinct religious denominations, during seventy years.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; To begin with the Church of England.&nbsp; I remember
hearing a sermon by the late Bishop of Manchester, at the
reopening of Chester Cathedral, when, in no measured terms, he
dwelt upon ecclesiastical abuses, as they existed during the last
century, and the earliest part of the present.&nbsp; He exposed
the nepotism of bishops, the worldliness of clergymen, and the
indifference of Church-people to religion in general.&nbsp; About
the same time another prelate privately told me that things in
his diocese, when he was first consecrated, had reached such a
point as made it wonderful how the Establishment had
survived.&nbsp; He complained of the limited power diocesans had
at command, to repress existing evils, <a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>and gave an
instance, how in his own case he had spent a large sum without
any effect for the removal of a clergyman who had dishonoured his
profession.&nbsp; About the facts charged against the delinquent
there could be no doubt, but proceedings failed through technical
objections.&nbsp; I remember when I was a youth there were
scandals in the diocese of Norwich, publicly known, yet legally
unassailable.&nbsp; Plurality and non-residence were
notorious.&nbsp; Preaching was neglected to a shameful degree; in
one case fifteen churches were served by three incumbents.&nbsp;
Livings had to be sequestered through clerical insolvency or
scandalous misconduct.&nbsp; Bishop Stanley wrought a great
reformation in these respects, much to the dismay of delinquents,
much to the satisfaction of parishioners.&nbsp; I remember him
perfectly well.&nbsp; Of slight figure, with white hair, he
tripped along the streets of Norwich on a Sunday, to one church
after another without giving beforehand notice of his movements,
but surprising rector or curate at the close of the service by
rising to pronounce the benediction.&nbsp; He was as unremitting
and efficient in his clerical position, as he had before been in
his naval duties.&nbsp; The magistrates&rsquo; seat prepared
Ambrose for his episcopate at Milan: the deck of a ship prepared
Edward Stanley to rule the diocese of Norwich.</p>
<p><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>The
typical High Church clergyman of my early days was a person
perfunctorily discharging his duties, living on civil terms with
his parishioners, known in the parish by clerical costume,
reading prayers in a surplice, and preaching in a black gown,
visiting the best society in the neighbourhood, kind to the poor,
and looking upon Dissenters as a rather suspicious class.</p>
<p>But a great change took place in 1832.&nbsp; Earnest men, as
we have seen, arose at Oxford, who devoted themselves to the
study of certain Anglo-Catholic divines and Greek and Latin
fathers.&nbsp; Some of them introduced ritualistic practices,
older than the Reformation.&nbsp; The change under Henry VIII.
and Elizabeth was approved by them no further than as it wiped
away stains from the face of popery.&nbsp; I recollect a High
Church layman telling me he liked an ornate service, but that he
was left far behind by the newly advanced party.&nbsp; I have
myself witnessed ceremonies in Anglican churches so nearly
approaching the Romanistic that only a practised eye could
discern the difference.&nbsp; There were, however, men of another
order, who had a liking for Anglo-Catholic theology, but eschewed
revived ceremonialism; and I have heard a High Churchman in
Westminster Abbey preach such a sermon on the necessity of the
Holy Spirit <a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>for the salvation of souls as, with a few expressions,
a Methodist might have delivered.&nbsp; He pronounced a glowing
eulogium on John Wesley.&nbsp; On one side this clergyman
appeared a warm-hearted Evangelical, on the other, he was a
staunch High Churchman.</p>
<p>When I think of Evangelicals early in this century, they
present a different class from men of the type just
described.&nbsp; As a boy in Norwich I heard Simeon of Cambridge,
and Legh Richmond of Turvey; and I remember them at this moment
as they appeared in the autumn of that year to advocate the
British and Foreign Bible Society.&nbsp; The former of the two
does not come to my recollection so vividly as the latter; him I
can now see, with his pleasant face, and large spectacles,
mounting, with a lame foot, the pulpit stairs of St.
Lawrence&rsquo;s Church&mdash;attired, not in a white surplice,
but in a black gown: nothing priestly in his appearance and
manner.&nbsp; His sermon was on behalf of the Society for
Promoting Christianity among Jews.&nbsp; He took for his text,
&ldquo;For thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour
the dust thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a soft, winning voice, and
&ldquo;a sweet reasonableness&rdquo; he discoursed on the
interest, which all Christians should feel in building up the
Church of God, especially with stones gathered from ruins of the
House of Israel.&nbsp; In St Andrew&rsquo;s Hall <a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>he spoke on
behalf of the Bible Society, and related a conversation he had on
the subject with the Emperor Alexander of Russia, when he visited
England after the Napoleonic wars.&nbsp; He also told touching
stories of what the Word of God could do for people amidst sins
and sorrows.&nbsp; As to Charles Simeon, whom I heard, he did not
penetrate like dew, but came down with hailstones and coals of
fire.</p>
<p>At a later period Episcopalians bestirred themselves in many
parts of the country, and from end to end, in building and other
efforts for church extension, and I recollect Dean Alford told me
how surprised the Church Commissioners were at the liberal
response given to challenges for aiding ecclesiastical
objects.</p>
<p>In 1865 the old Act of Uniformity was modified so as to
relieve the consciences of such as scrupled to declare unfeigned
consent to everything contained in the Prayer-Book.&nbsp;
<i>Now</i> the requirement was an assent to the Articles, the
Common Prayer, and the Ordering of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons,
and a declaration that the doctrine of the Establishment was
agreeable to the Word of God.&nbsp; In 1867 a commission was
appointed to regulate public worship, the result of which was
unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>In
former pages of this volume I have noticed devoted and exemplary
Churchmen through whom my own soul has been nourished and
stimulated.&nbsp; It would be ungrateful not to recognise, on
these pages, spiritual benefit I have derived from sermons
preached and books written by living Churchmen.</p>
<p>Before I close this section of reminiscences touching the
Church of England it will be interesting to notice an accession
to it of a remarkable person who had previously been a
Dissenter.&nbsp; Her name, now so extensively known, was Sarah
Martin.&nbsp; My old friend Mr. Walford often alluded to her in
his conversations, and in his Autobiography, written in a series
of letters published by his direction, he gives the following
narrative:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This young woman, during my residence in
Yarmouth, supported by her needle both herself and, I think, also
an aged grandmother, with whom she lived at Caister, near
Yarmouth.&nbsp; When I first knew her she was, I imagine, about
twenty years of age.&nbsp; She introduced herself to me as one
who had been as inconsiderate and negligent of religion, as she
was ignorant of the nature of genuine Christianity.&nbsp; By some
means, which I do not now remember, she was induced to come to
the New Meeting, where she heard one or more discourses <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>from me,
which, she assured me, had produced very deep impressions upon
her, and entirely changed the character of her mind and
conduct.&nbsp; She subsequently became a member of the Church of
which I was the pastor, and was most diligent and attentive to
the public and private meetings of the Church.&nbsp; I found her
to possess great energy of mind, by the exercise of which she
very soon became well informed in the truths and duties of
Christianity, and ardently disposed to do any good that was
compatible with her station in life.&nbsp; Her affection for me
was such that it is not too much to say of her, as St. Paul did
of his converts among the Galatians, that, if it had been
possible, they would have plucked out their own eyes and have
given them to him (Gal. iv. 15).&nbsp; Her regard for me, and the
ministry I exercised, continued unalterable through the several
years in which I resided in Yarmouth, after my acquaintance with
her commenced.&nbsp; I afterwards saw her several times during
occasional visits which I made to that place, when I found that
she still retained an affectionate remembrance of me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was in humble circumstances, and earned a scanty income by
the use of her needle; but she coupled with it extraordinary
efforts for <a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>the good of others, and this disposed some ladies,
members of the Established Church, to contribute to her
support.&nbsp; This enabled her to devote more time to her
charitable work, and at length she was so absorbed in it that she
became a kind of missionary to the inmates of the workhouse and
the prisoners in Yarmouth gaol.&nbsp; She read and explained the
Scriptures to them, and in devotional service, she carried on for
their spiritual welfare, she employed parts of the Church
Prayer-Book.&nbsp; Gradually, I infer, she became attached to
those who helped her, and this association led to her becoming a
member of the Establishment.&nbsp; After her death a
commemorative window was placed in Yarmouth parish church, and at
its reopening, after a costly restoration, Bishop Wilberforce
pronounced an eloquent eulogium on Sarah Martin&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; Some intimate Nonconformist friends of mine
remained attached to her, and showed me numerous MSS. in her
handwriting.</p>
<p>I now return to the ranks of Dissent and proceed to
notice&mdash;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; English Presbyterianism.&nbsp; A word on its earlier
history will here be appropriate.&nbsp; The Presbyterians of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were orthodox.&nbsp; After
the Restoration many of <a name="page369"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 369</span>them adhered to the Westminster
Confession, but a departure from it, in some instances, appeared
in the century after.&nbsp; Arian and Socinian opinions began to
obtain, but those who held them claimed connection with the
Presbyterians of the Commonwealth, on the ground that they
followed such worthies in the exercise of religious freedom and
the rights of conscience.&nbsp; Their forefathers had repudiated
the Prayer-Book, and now they, their sons in the cause of
religious freedom, renounced the Westminster Confession.&nbsp;
For the most part they remained steadfast in believing New
Testament miracles.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Madge, a noted English
Presbyterian, sixty or seventy years ago, said to me once, he
could not understand how a man could be called a Christian who
did not believe in our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>During the reign of William IV. the two most prominent English
Presbyterians of the old school were the Rev. Mr. Aspland and Mr.
Madge.&nbsp; The latter I knew well.&nbsp; Mr. Aspland was an
eloquent speaker, and exerted himself conspicuously in the cause
of Unitarianism, with which he identified the interests of
religious freedom.&nbsp; His son, in writing his father&rsquo;s
life, pourtrays that gentleman&rsquo;s religious connections,
social virtues, and decision of character; <a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>but does
not conceal his warmth of temper, and dislike to certain eminent
Trinitarians.&nbsp; Mr. Madge, before he became minister of Essex
Street, London, was for some years settled in my native city, and
presided over a wealthy congregation, in which were several
distinguished literary and artistic people.&nbsp; The Martineaus,
the Aldersons, the Starks, and other distinguished families, were
of the number.&nbsp; They worshipped in the Octagon Chapel, as it
was called from its architecture, and for a number of years the
building was the most distinguished Nonconformist place of
worship in the eastern capital.&nbsp; It was rather sumptuously
fitted up in my boyish days, and the attendants were not wont to
mix much with other Dissenters.&nbsp; If there were any fault in
this, I dare say it was shared on both sides.</p>
<p>Returning to the English Presbyterians at large, but
especially as they existed in London, I must speak of a trust
established by Dr. Williams, of the last century.&nbsp; He was
orthodox, but the administration of funds bequeathed by him came
into the hands of those Presbyterians who deviated from his
doctrinal views, but still retained the Presbyterian name by
which he was known.&nbsp; Though Unitarians in opinion, they by
no means confined <a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>their charity to Unitarian ministers and chapels; and
still the &ldquo;Williams&rsquo; Scholarships&rdquo; are enjoyed
by students preparing for orthodox ministrations amongst
Independents.&nbsp; Dr. Martineau was for some time an
administrator of the trust, but strongly objected to the
exclusion of orthodox ministers from its administration.</p>
<p>During the last century there were Presbyterians in England
holding decidedly Evangelical views, and of late there have been
numerous congregations gathered, which, in their unity, form what
is called &ldquo;The Presbyterian Church in England.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Scotch brethren of great renown&mdash;Dr. James Hamilton, Dr.
Young, and Dr. Archer&mdash;I had the privilege of numbering
amongst personal friends, and they were held in honour by all
Evangelical Churchmen and Nonconformists.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Another large section of brethren were Baptists,
distinguished by certain <i>doctrinal</i> and <i>disciplinary</i>
views;&mdash;the former as Particular or Calvinistic, on the one
hand, and General or Arminian on the other;&mdash;the latter as
Open communionists and Strict communionists.&nbsp; Open
communionists admit to the Lord&rsquo;s table those who have not
been baptised by immersion; Strict communionists confine the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper to those <a name="page372"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 372</span>who have been immersed.&nbsp; Such
distinctions are now fading away.&nbsp; Calvinists and Arminians
are comprehended in the same union, and Strict communionists are
comparatively few.</p>
<p>Robert Hall, the advocate of Open communion, I never saw: he
died when I was young.&nbsp; Joseph Kinghorn, his opponent, a
distinguished Hebrew scholar, I knew well, as he lived in Norwich
during my boyhood.&nbsp; William Brock, who succeeded him, and
afterwards became minister of Bloomsbury Chapel, London, entered
the ministry about the same time as I did, and we regarded each
other with warm affection.&nbsp; Dr. Cox and Dr. Steane were
widely known in the religious world, and with both of them I
entered into a fellowship of work and worship at the opening of
chapels and on other public occasions.&nbsp; John Howard Hinton
was another Baptist brother, of whom I saw much when he was at
Reading and I was at Windsor.&nbsp; He was more original, more
metaphysical, more scientific, and more excitable than others
whom I have mentioned, perhaps of a higher intellectual order,
and still greater depth of religious emotion.&nbsp; Mr. Spurgeon,
who has so recently left the world, and whose influence and fame
extended further than any other Nonconformist in modern times, I
greatly respected <a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
373</span>and admired; and though I did not share his intimacy, I
saw something of him in my own home, and a little more in his,
where he had a magnificent library, and received his numerous
friends with cordiality.&nbsp; His popularity amongst
aristocratic people was, for a little time, much greater than is
generally supposed, for I was informed by a lady of distinction
that for some weeks in his early career he was a leading topic of
conversation in upper circles.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; I now turn to the Quaker community.&nbsp; Well do I
remember meetings at the Goldencroft, Norwich, where, at the
upper end, sat men and women called Public Friends.&nbsp; My
mother, born in 1770, told me of yearly meetings held in our old
city, when sometimes Friends from America attended: and so great
was the number of visitors that it raised the market price of
provisions.&nbsp; Some ladies who came from the other side of the
Atlantic wore dresses with open skirts and green aprons.&nbsp; No
bows of ribbon were seen, while bonnets of black and of
lead-coloured silk crowned the heads of young and old.&nbsp; What
Charles Lamb says in his &ldquo;Elia&rdquo; corresponds with what
I recollect, and what my mother used to tell me, how
&ldquo;troops of the shining ones&rdquo; were seen walking the
streets, on their way to the house of worship, where their
silence was more eloquent than speech.&nbsp; I have read with <a
name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 374</span>sympathy
&ldquo;The Life of John Woolman,&rdquo; written by himself, and
so warmly recommended by the essayist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get,&rdquo;
says Charles Lamb, &ldquo;the writings of John Woolman by heart,
and love the early Quakers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very serious diversion in theological opinion existed among
American Friends early in this century, and it is because an
effect of it appeared in England that it is noticed here.&nbsp; A
French Friend&mdash;the well-known Stephen
Grellet&mdash;travelling in the States, makes this entry in his
journal, under date 1822:&mdash;&ldquo;We proceeded to Long
Island, where I attended all the meetings, but here my
soul&rsquo;s distress exceeded all I had known during the
preceding months, though my baptism had been deep.&nbsp; I found
that the greatest part of the members of our Society and many of
the ministers and elders, are carried away by the principle which
Elias Hicks has so assiduously propagated among them.&nbsp; He
now speaks out boldly, disguising his sentiments no longer; he
seeks to invalidate the Holy Scriptures, and sets up man&rsquo;s
reason as his only guide, openly denying the divinity of
Christ.&nbsp; I have had many expostulations with him in which I
have most tenderly pleaded with him, but all has been in
vain.&rdquo; <a name="citation374"></a><a href="#footnote374"
class="citation">[374]</a>&nbsp; From what I have read in
American literature <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>touching what is known as the
Hicksite controversy, it appears to me plainly indicative of a
denial among many American Friends, that Jesus Christ, in the
orthodox sense of the term, was Divine, and that He did not make
any atonement for sin.&nbsp; Hicks appears to have been a
thorough mystic, unintelligible to common-sense people.&nbsp; At
all events he converted many to his views; and these views were
caught up by some Friends in this country.&nbsp; To what extent
exactly they were adopted in England I cannot say: but they
created alarm amongst many Friends on this side the
Atlantic.&nbsp; Great sorrow at the abandonment of Evangelical
doctrines led to secessions from Quakerism on the part of
excellent people who had been born and bred in the
community.&nbsp; Some of them resided, at the time I speak of, on
the borders of Wales, others in the county of York.&nbsp; They
became Congregationalists, and in tours on behalf of the London
Missionary Society, I was received hospitably in their homes, and
had gratifying opportunities of witnessing their beautiful
Christian life.</p>
<p>Joseph John Gurney, of Earlham, felt seriously concerned
respecting the American defection, in a community to which he had
been attached from childhood.&nbsp; He had studied in the
University of Oxford, had cultivated friendships in other
denominations, <a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>was a good classic and Biblical scholar, and also an
author of theological works.&nbsp; Mr. Gurney was
&ldquo;concerned&rdquo; about the effect of Hicksite opinion on
American and English Friends, and therefore took up his pen and
wrote in reply to the leader who had done so much mischief.</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney, like his sister Mrs. Fry, undertook journeys for
preaching the Gospel, and once he visited Windsor for that
purpose.&nbsp; I was unwell at the time, but he called and talked
by my bedside, and commended me to God in prayer.&nbsp; Several
Quaker families at that period were living at Staines and
Uxbridge; with them I had much intercourse, especially when we
were joined in the advocacy of Slave Emancipation.&nbsp; The
community, in both towns now named, was considerable for numbers
and for wealth.</p>
<p>Friends now dress, speak and act much like other people.&nbsp;
Conforming to common custom, they still eschew all extravagances
of fashion.&nbsp; They no longer forfeit membership by
&ldquo;marrying out of Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Right
Honourable John Bright&rdquo; (how shocked George Fox would have
been at the title!) told me once, that relaxation in strictness
as to unimportant points, had checked a decline in numbers going
on before.</p>
<p><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>V.&nbsp; Methodism, of course, brings to my mind a long
train of early associations.&nbsp; Not merely names, but living
forms, of noted preachers belonging to the second decade of this
century come back to my recollection.</p>
<p>Calvert Street Chapel was opened about 1812, and Dr. Coke
preached.</p>
<p>I cannot say that I remember his sermon; but, as noticed
already, I distinctly recollect seeing the odd-looking,
diminutive man, standing on a table talking in the committee room
of Bethel Hospital <a name="citation377"></a><a
href="#footnote377" class="citation">[377]</a> adorned by
paintings of foundress and governors.&nbsp; Dr. Coke
energetically addressed on the occasion a number of people, who
had been invited by my grandfather, to hear the noted advocate of
Methodist missions.&nbsp; Many years afterwards I mentioned the
circumstance to a gentleman, who at the time took care of the
patients, when he fetched an old committee book, in which this
gathering was noticed, with a minute expressing the displeasure
of the Governors at such a liberty being taken, and forbidding
anything of the kind in future.&nbsp; The Wesleyan congregations
in Norwich were then very large, and <i>local</i>
preachers&mdash;uncultivated men in humble life&mdash;<a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>frequently
occupied the pulpit in the afternoon service at Calvert Street,
and, remember, delivered animated discourses likely to do their
hearers good.</p>
<p>Dr. Jabez Bunting was a very influential man among the
Methodists when I was young.&nbsp; For many years he was regarded
as ruler of the Connexion,&mdash;exerting a despotic sway over
the whole body.&nbsp; Such general conclusions oftentimes are not
fairly drawn from existing facts, and how far widely extended
opinion in the case now noticed, is justifiable I cannot
undertake to say.&nbsp; To me he was very agreeable, and for him
I had great respect.&nbsp; William Bunting, his son, was of a
different stamp from his father, and though a skilful critic, he
had not his father&rsquo;s gift of authority and rule.</p>
<p>Before the middle of the century came Dr. Newton, to open a
second chapel, in the upper part of Norwich; his magnificent
voice and careful diction produced a powerful effect.&nbsp; I met
him in after-life at Windsor, when he told me that he was
accustomed to leave his home on Monday morning in the Manchester
circuit, and travel by coach to the other end of
England,&mdash;perhaps cross over to Ireland,&mdash;and then get
back, at the end of the week, ready for preaching the next
day.&nbsp; He said he weekly delivered five or six sermons,
making <a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>them &ldquo;on the wheels&rdquo; as he went
along.&nbsp; He seemed a stranger to physical fatigue.</p>
<p>During my Windsor ministry I became acquainted with a noted
Wesleyan, who was not an itinerant, but a local, preacher.&nbsp;
He went by the name of &ldquo;Billy Dawson,&rdquo; and was
eminently gifted with humour and pathos.&nbsp; I heard him
preach, and listened to his platform speeches.&nbsp; He was not
only naturally eloquent, but histrionic too; in speeches and
sermons he acted while he spoke.&nbsp; He made you realise what
he described.&nbsp; It is said that George Whitefield, when
preaching to sailors, described a storm at sea so vividly that
some of them shouted, &ldquo;Take to the long boat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dawson had a like power of realising what he described.&nbsp; He
would, at a missionary meeting, make a telescope of his
resolution, and putting it to one of his eyes, describe what he
saw in imagination,&mdash;perhaps a picture of the millennium
drawn from Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecies.&nbsp; I was young, just
come from college, at the time I speak of, and made a speech in
which I used some words which were not so plain as they might
have been.&nbsp; After the meeting he spoke to me kindly,
suggesting equivalent terms in plain Saxon.&nbsp; It was a good
lesson for an unfledged bird.</p>
<p><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>When
I was a member of the Wesleyan Society, I attended class
according to rule, and I found the practice beneficial, inasmuch
as it was a constant spur to self-examination.&nbsp; The
primitive agape, revived amongst the Methodists, exists under the
name of love-feast, at which, together with eating bread and
drinking water as an expression of fellowship, men and women are
accustomed voluntarily to rise, and give some account of their
religious experience for edification to others.&nbsp; These
addresses I found often interesting and useful.&nbsp; By such
means, a habit of spiritual intercommunication amongst Methodists
is kept alive; beneficial in some cases no doubt, but liable to
abuse in others, as most good things are.&nbsp; I am constrained
to relate how this habit on the bright side manifested itself on
a private occasion during a meeting of Conference in
London.&nbsp; Dr. Jobson, an eminent Wesleyan, invited a party of
friends to his house.&nbsp; He kindly included me in the number,
and I found at his hospitable board the President for the year,
and some ex-presidents.&nbsp; Together with them, Drs. Binney,
Raleigh, Allon, and Donald Fraser were present.&nbsp; Our host
was a thorough Methodist, and very comprehensive in his
sympathies, for he had mixed with different denominations.&nbsp;
He <a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>had
many friends in the Establishment, and in early life had studied
under an eminent Roman Catholic architect, at whose house he met
bishops and priests of that communion.&nbsp; On the occasion I
refer to, he in an easy way initiated a conversation which I can
never forget.&nbsp; He appealed to his guests, one by one, for
some account of their religious life.&nbsp; All readily
responded; and this is most remarkable,&mdash;all who spoke
attributed to Methodism spiritual influence of a decisive
kind.&nbsp; To use Wesleyan phraseology, most of them had been
&ldquo;brought to God&rdquo; through Methodist
instrumentality.&nbsp; Dr. Osborne was present, and made some
remarks, at the close of which, with choked utterance, he
repeated the verse&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And if our fellowship below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jesus be so sweet,<br />
What heights of rapture shall we know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When round the throne we meet?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Norwich Methodists were chiefly humble folks with a
sprinkling of some in better circumstances; their habits were
very simple and they looked upon some who made money as becoming
&ldquo;worldly,&rdquo; or at least, as exposed to
temptation.&nbsp; At that time, however, such as possessed social
comforts could not be justly charged with conformity to the
course of <a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>this world; and over their little gatherings in one
another&rsquo;s houses there was shed a religious atmosphere such
as was breathed in class and love-feast.&nbsp; Early in the
century on a Sunday, between afternoon and evening service, there
might be a large tea-party, where the preacher, a class-leader,
and other members of Society would talk and pray and sing, till
it was time to go to evening service at chapel.&nbsp; This
communion seems to me now as I think of it such as is described
in Malachi: &ldquo;Then they that feared the Lord spake often one
to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it; and a book of
remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord
and that thought upon His name; and they shall be Mine, saith the
Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels, and I will
spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worldly prosperity has since fallen to the lot of not a few
Methodists, and the usual temptations surrounding wealth have
tested their character; but I am thankful to say, amongst those
whom I have visited, I have found beautiful instances of
adherence to religious principles.&nbsp; I may mention a friend
already noticed, Sir William McArthur, K.C.M.G.&nbsp; When Lord
Mayor of London he continued his previous Wesleyan duties; and
whilst bountiful in his hospitality <a name="page383"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 383</span>eschewed usages of a fashionable
kind.&nbsp; In his year of office the &OElig;cumenical Conference
was held, and during its meetings repeated Mansion House
invitations were given to friends in sympathy with Evangelical
religion.&nbsp; I attended his funeral, and in his residence on
Notting Hill a large number of mourners assembled, and we had a
short devotional service together, very touching, tender, and
beautiful.</p>
<p>My personal recollections of Methodism, which roll back more
than seventy years ago, linger round Yarmouth and Norwich.&nbsp;
At Yarmouth I used to worship on a Sunday in a curious
old-fashioned square chapel, with galleries on the four
sides.&nbsp; There was a deep one opposite the two entrance
doors, and attached to the front of that gallery was a
pulpit&mdash;by what means, as a boy, I never could make
out.&nbsp; The preacher ascended from behind by a staircase,
invisible to the congregation, and then from the top of the
staircase descended by two or three steps into a curiously shaped
pulpit.&nbsp; I distinctly recollect the venerable Joseph Benson,
then a patriarch, who had been associated with Methodists in John
Wesley&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; I think I see him now, of slender
frame, venerable aspect, and wearing a coat of dark purple.&nbsp;
Of course I have no recollection of what he said, but he was
regarded as a saintly man in those days.&nbsp; In <a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>the autumn
Yarmouth was frequented by a number of mariners from the
north&mdash;coblemen they were called&mdash;who had come to fish
for herrings off the Yarmouth coast.&nbsp; They were staunch
Methodists, and used to hold a prayer-meeting after the general
service.&nbsp; How those men used to pray with stentorian voice,
which called forth loud &ldquo;Amens&rdquo; from voices all over
the chapel!</p>
<p>In Calvert Street, Norwich, there used to be special services
on Christmas-day.&nbsp; After a prayer-meeting at six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning there was preaching at seven
o&rsquo;clock, when hymns appropriate to the season were sung,
accompanied by violins and wind instruments of different
kinds.&nbsp; I did not fail, between five and six o&rsquo;clock,
to rise and cross the city in order to be in good time for these
services.&nbsp; They usually commenced with the hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Christians, awake, salute the happy morn<br
/>
Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born;<br />
Rise to adore the mystery of love,<br />
Which hosts of angels chanted from above;<br />
With them the joyful tidings first begun<br />
Of God incarnate and the Virgin&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,<br />
Who heard the angelic herald&rsquo;s voice: &lsquo;Behold,<br />
I bring good tidings of a Saviour&rsquo;s birth,<br />
To you and all the nations upon earth:<br />
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,<br />
This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>With
the Methodist chapel in Calvert Street my earliest religious
thoughts are connected.&nbsp; Watch-nights and love-feasts, are
sacred in my recollection.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; Respecting the Congregationalist denomination, of
which I have spoken already, let me add that in 1877 I was
requested by Dr. Schaff, of New York, to give my impression of
prevalent beliefs amongst us.&nbsp; I replied as follows:
&ldquo;Looking at the principles of Congregationalism, which
involve the repudiation of all human authority in matters of
religion, it is impossible to believe that persons holding those
principles can consistently regard any ecclesiastical creed or
symbol in the same way as Catholics, whether Roman or Anglican,
regard the creeds of the ancient Church.&nbsp; There is a strong
feeling against the use of such documents for the purpose of
defining limits of religious communion, or for the purpose of
checking the exercise of free inquiry; and there is also a
widespread conviction that it is impossible to reduce the
expression of Christian belief to a series of logical
propositions, so as to preserve and represent the full spirit of
Gospel truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; (See Schaff&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creeds of
Christendom,&rdquo; p. 833.)</p>
<p>No doubt there may be heard in some circles loose
conversation, seeming to indicate such a repugnance <a
name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>to creeds
as would imply a dislike to all formal definitions of Christian
doctrine; but I apprehend the prevailing sentiment relative to
this subject among our ministers and churches does not go beyond
the point just indicated.&nbsp; Many of them consider that while
creeds are objectionable as tests, and imperfect as confessions,
they may have a certain value as manifestoes of conviction, on
the part of different communities.</p>
<p>Some people write and talk on the subject of present opinion,
with a positiveness which only omniscience could warrant.&nbsp;
No mortal can know what is going on in the minds of thousands,
touching momentous subjects; yet such knowledge is requisite for
the confident conclusions of certain critics.&nbsp; We may speak
decidedly of what is commonly taught in a community, yet this
should be done with qualifications and no farther.</p>
<p>Silence on momentous points may prove a loss as to the full
wealth of theology; but I am thankful for gain at the present day
in richer views than formerly of our Lord&rsquo;s character, and
the bearing of it upon life and conduct.&nbsp; Let me add,
however, if <i>Redemption</i> in all its fulness be not prominent
in pulpit ministrations, power will be gone.&nbsp; Some suppose
we are making theological advance, and that <a
name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>discoveries
are opening akin to those in physical science; but people who
have more carefully surveyed the wide field, and more observantly
studied the history of religious thought, discover that much as
seen at first sight, is chiefly a falling back upon what was old
and forgotten.</p>
<p>In closing what I have to say of modern Congregationalists, I
venture to notice deceased ministers whom it has been a privilege
to number amongst my friends.</p>
<p>I knew but slightly the Rev. William Jay of Bath.&nbsp; He has
been incidentally noticed in these pages already, for he was old
when I was young.&nbsp; He rose from a lowly rank in life to be
regarded as teacher and companion by the intellectual and
noble.&nbsp; Mrs. Hannah More valued his ministrations and
cultivated his society.&nbsp; Wilberforce used to attend his
chapel when staying at Bath; and an Indian ruler, when in
England, went to hear him at Surrey Chapel, and expressed great
admiration of the sermon.</p>
<p>The next to be mentioned is John Angell James of
Birmingham.&nbsp; I remember perfectly well the first sermon I
heard him preach when I was a student.&nbsp; The text was:
&ldquo;Our conversation (or citizenship) is in
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice was richly <a
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>toned&mdash;a genuine birth gift improved by
culture.&nbsp; He introduced the following illustration: A
pilgrim in the Middle Ages, on his way to Jerusalem, passed
through Constantinople.&nbsp; A friend took him from street to
street, pausing to point out attractions, in magnificent
buildings, and the rich scenery of the Golden Horn.&nbsp; He
wondered the traveller was not enchanted.&nbsp; The latter
replied: &ldquo;Yes, all very fine, <i>but it is not the Holy
City</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The application was obvious and well
enforced.</p>
<p>Dr. Raffles of Liverpool&mdash;noticed already as one of my
companions to Rome&mdash;and Dr. Hamilton of Leeds, well known
throughout England, won the affections of their people by
sympathetic intercourse, and interested them by eloquent
instructions and appeals.&nbsp; The former enunciated his
carefully prepared periods with a voice naturally musical, the
latter delivered his thoughts in condensed sentences, which
reminded one of a person taking very short steps.&nbsp; There was
an intellectual power in the sermons of the last-named, not
indicated in those of the former.</p>
<p>John Alexander of Norwich I cannot pass by without
notice.&nbsp; Like David, he was a youth with ruddy
countenance.&nbsp; His speech throughout a sermon fell gentle as
a snowflake, without any coldness of <a name="page389"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 389</span>touch.&nbsp; He read much, and made
good use of what he read.&nbsp; The charm of his private life and
conversation exceeded the effect of his public ministry, though
that was great.</p>
<p>I must mention another name.&nbsp; John Harris was for some
years a secluded pastor at Epsom, little known.&nbsp; He wrote
&ldquo;The Great Teacher,&rdquo; but though far above the common
level of such literature, it made little impression, compared
with its merits.&nbsp; A prize was offered for an essay on
Covetousness and Christian Liberality.&nbsp; Harris won the
prize, and printed the essay.&nbsp; The effect was
instantaneous.</p>
<p>The book sold edition after edition, and the author&rsquo;s
name became generally familiar.&nbsp; Requests for his services
were universal.&nbsp; He was everywhere talked about, and when he
preached places were crowded.&nbsp; His popularity lasted as long
as he lived, but he died when he was fifty-four.&nbsp; He was
unassuming, kind-hearted, generous to poor ministers, genial in
conversation, and beloved by all who knew him.</p>
<p>Another brother must be mentioned&mdash;Baldwin Brown&mdash;of
superior intellectual type, well educated, an extensive reader,
and one who delighted in a large circle of sympathetic
friends.&nbsp; He gathered round him a good congregation,
composed chiefly of thoughtful people, who became assimilated to
his <a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>characteristic teachings.&nbsp; He wore himself out by
incessant study and pulpit service.</p>
<p>I must not pass by David Thomas of Bristol, my fellow-student
and friend through life, whose elevated and genial character won
from a wide circle warm attachment, and whose unique pulpit power
captivated all capable of sympathising with one so thoughtful and
so good.</p>
<p>Nor can I omit Alexander Raleigh, my successor for a short
period at Kensington, who fulfilled a ministry dear to many who
listened with delight to his characteristic teaching.</p>
<p>The last name I mention is that of Samuel Martin, minister at
Westminster Chapel.&nbsp; He had gifts of a peculiar description,
which marked him off, and made him stand by himself, both as
minister and man.&nbsp; His appearance, voice, manner, habits,
were all his own.&nbsp; He <i>lived</i> for his Church, in whose
interests he was thoroughly absorbed.&nbsp; No one not intimately
acquainted with him could have an adequate idea how he loved his
flock, and lived for their welfare week by week.&nbsp; I had
reverent affection for him as a saintly man, and I witnessed
evidence amongst his large circle, in town and country, how he
watched for souls as one that must give an account.&nbsp; His
congregation during Parliament months included several <a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>M.P.&rsquo;s, whom he gathered together for patriotic
prayer.</p>
<p>His neighbour, Dr. Stanley, had a reverent regard for Mr.
Martin, and I know that the Dean and Lady Augusta went to
Westminster Chapel to hear his voice and worship with his
people.&nbsp; He spoke to me of him in terms of strong affection,
also telling me of a brother clergyman who, after a visit to his
sick chamber, pronounced him one of the most saintly men he had
ever seen.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
